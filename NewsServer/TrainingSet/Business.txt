[([u'DEALBOOK; Hedge Fund Manager And S.E.C. Reach Deal'], [u'\n                    12:24 a.m. | Updated \n\n        ', u'\n                    \nWhen federal regulators sued the high-flying money manager Philip A. Falcone last summer, they claimed his actions \u201cread like the final exam in a graduate school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully.\u201d        ', u'\n                    By Thursday, the agency appeared to be softening its tone.        ', u'\n                    Nearly a year after the', u' of manipulating the market, using hedge fund assets to pay his own taxes and \u201csecretly\u201d favoring select customers at the expense of others, Mr. Falcone disclosed in a public filing that he had \u201creached an agreement in principle\u201d to settle the two cases with the agency. The S.E.C. also struck a deal with Harbinger Capital Partners, Mr. Falcone\u2019s flagship hedge fund.        ', u'\n                    The settlement, which came after a federal judge in New York questioned aspects of the cases, would be a moral victory of sorts for Mr. Falcone, who has stubbornly resisted a deal for more than a year. It might also reignite concerns that the S.E.C.\u2019s results sometimes fall short of its ambitions.        ', u'\n                    The S.E.C.\u2019s punishment of Mr. Falcone appeared steep, if only because it spelled an end to his long career as a hedge fund wizard. Mr. Falcone, who made a fortune betting against the subprime mortgage market in 2007, has agreed to at least a two-year ban from raising new capital, a death knell for a hedge fund manager. He must also \u201ctake all actions reasonably necessary to expeditiously\u201d return money to investors who are fleeing the fund, according to the public filing on Thursday.        ', u'\n                    But with the exodus of capital, and a wireless venture that he bankrolled in bankruptcy, Mr. Falcone\u2019s hedge fund was already resigned to its fate. And the fine print of the S.E.C. deal suggests that Mr. Falcone, who is not required to admit or deny the agency\u2019s accusations, could escape relatively unscathed.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe settlement, itself, would change very little in Falcone\u2019s life,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and of business at the University of Michigan.        ', u'\n                    For one, the deal comes with an $18 million penalty from the S.E.C. \u2014 a rounding error to a hedge fund billionaire. Mr. Falcone will personally pay $4 million of the penalty, according to people briefed on the matter, while the fund\u2019s management company will pay the rest. One of the people briefed on the matter noted that $18 million was higher than what Mr. Falcone initially offered to pay and was a substantial sum given that the hedge fund\u2019s investors did not suffer any financial harm.        ', u'\n                    Still, the two-year ban comes with a loophole. According to the people briefed on the matter, the ban does not apply to the nine investment advisers that Mr. Falcone runs through Harbinger Capital. The S.E.C. granted the carve-out, the people said, so Mr. Falcone could unwind the hedge fund without harming investors by selling off pieces at fire-sale prices.        ', u'\n                    More important, perhaps, Mr. Falcone can retain his control of the Harbinger Group, a publicly traded conglomerate that he uses to make a broad array of investments. In recent years, Mr. Falcone has started to emerge as something of a private equity investor, taking varied stakes in the insurance business and consumer goods industry, including the company that produces the George Foreman grill. That business remains largely unaffected by the S.E.C. deal.        ', u'\n                    The settlement, the people said, is also notable for something that it did not include: a common provision that prohibits defendants from committing future violations with fraudulent intent.        ', u'\n                    The lack of a so-called fraud injunction, an unusual victory for the target of an S.E.C. action, is a reminder of broader concerns about the toughness of the agency. During the tenure of Robert Khuzami, the former enforcement chief of the S.E.C. who filed major cases against Wall Street firms, the agency came under scrutiny for not leveling bigger fines. He notably butted heads with a federal judge in New York, Jed S. Rakoff, who in 2010 called the agency\u2019s $150 million settlement with Bank of America over lax public disclosures \u201chalf-baked justice at best.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Now that the S.E.C. is in transition under a new chairwoman, Mary Jo White, the agency is vowing once again to strike a hard line against financial fraud.        ', u'\n                    An S.E.C. spokesman declined to discuss the terms of the settlement with Mr. Falcone, given that approval of the agency\u2019s commissioners is still required. Mr. Falcone\u2019s lawyer, Matthew S. Dontzin, also declined to comment.        ', u'\n                    The settlement emerged after earlier attempts at a deal came up short. Mr. Falcone, the people briefed on the matter said, refused to settle last year as long as the S.E.C. insisted on applying an injunction against fraud, which would amount to something of a rebuke. In June, the S.E.C. held its ground, deciding to file its cases instead.        ', u'\n                    But then the S.E.C. received a warning sign from Judge Paul Crotty, who at a hearing in February declared that in one part of a case: \u201cI\u2019m having difficulty seeing exactly where the wrong occurred here.\u201d        ']), ([u'DEALBOOK; JPMorgan Sued Over Credit Card Debt Cases'], [u'\n                    California\u2019s top law enforcement official accused JPMorgan Chase on Thursday of flooding the state\u2019s courts with questionable lawsuits to collect overdue credit card debt.\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe suit, filed in California Superior Court by the state\u2019s attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, contends that JPMorgan, the nation\u2019s largest bank, \u201ccommitted debt collection abuses against tens of thousands of California consumers.\u201d        ', u'\n                    For about three years, between January 2008 and April 2011, JPMorgan filed thousands of lawsuits each month to collect soured credit card debt, Ms. Harris said. On a single day, for example, JPMorgan filed 469 lawsuits, court records show.        ', u'\n                    As the bank plowed through the lawsuits, Ms. Harris said, JPMorgan took shortcuts like relying on court documents that were not reviewed for accuracy. \u201cTo maintain this breakneck pace,\u201d according to the lawsuit, JPMorgan relied on \u201cunlawful practices.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The accusations outlined in the lawsuit echo problems \u2014 from questionable documents used in lawsuits to incomplete records \u2014 that plagued the foreclosure process and prompted a multibillion-dollar settlement with big banks. One hallmark of the foreclosure crisis, robosigning, in which banks worked through mountains of legal documents without reviewing them for accuracy, is at the center of Ms. Harris\u2019s lawsuit against JPMorgan.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan is already navigating a thicket of regulatory woes. The ', u', one of the bank\u2019s chief regulators, is preparing an enforcement action against the bank over the way it collects its credit card debt, according to several people close to the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the cases publicly.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan assembled a \u201cdebt collection mill that abuses the California judicial process,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Many of the lawsuits filed rely on questionable or incomplete records, Ms. Harris said. \u201cAt nearly every stage of the collection process,\u201d the bank \u201ccut corners in the name of speed, cost savings and their own convenience,\u201d she said.        ', u'\n                    Ms. Harris said she sought \u201cto hold Chase accountable for systematically using illegal tactics to flood California\u2019s courts with specious lawsuits against consumers.\u201d She said she aimed to get \u201credress for borrowers who have been harmed,\u201d but did not detail any request for specific damages.        ', u'\n                    While JPMorgan\u2019s debt collection practices are the ones under scrutiny, flaws are increasingly common in credit card lawsuits filed by rival banks, according to interviews with dozens of state judges, regulators and lawyers who defend consumers.        ', u'\n                    \u201cA vast number of the lawsuits are flawed and most of them can\u2019t prove the individual actually owes the debt,\u201d said ', u', a civil court judge in Brooklyn who said he had presided over as many as 150 such cases a day.        ', u'\n                    Ted Mermin, executive director of the Public Good Law Center in Berkeley, Calif., said, \u201cThis is in no way just a JPMorgan problem.\u201d        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. The bank, though, has been cooperating with regulators, including the California attorney general\u2019s office, to root out problems with its debt collection lawsuits, according to people briefed on the situation. Amid concerns that some of the underlying documentation was flawed, JPMorgan stopped filing new credit card lawsuits in 2011, these people said. In courts across the country, according to judges, JPMorgan has also been throwing out some pending lawsuits as well.        ', u'\n                    Some of the nation\u2019s biggest lenders are turning to the courts to collect money they are owed on a range of debts, from credit card balances to soured ', u', judges and lawyers for consumers say.        ', u'\n                    Since the financial crisis, fewer customers are falling behind on their bills and the morass of bad debt is shrinking. Still, lenders are working to clean up their books and whittle down the amount of soured loans, the judges say.        ', u'\n                    In most instances, the customers admit that they owe the money. The problem, though, judges and law enforcement officials say, is that credit card companies sometimes flout proper legal procedures to recover what they are owed. Many of the cases, according to Mr. Dear, the civil court judge in Brooklyn, hinge on erroneous documents, hastily assembled to make up for the fact that lenders have lost the original paperwork needed, like payment histories or the original contract. Some lawsuits rely on fabricated credit card statements, Mr. Dear said.        ', u'\n                    Lenders have been buffeted by this kind of criticism before over the way they pursued homeowners who had fallen behind on their mortgage payments. Last year, five of the nation\u2019s largest banks reached a $26 billion pact with 49 state attorneys general over claims the lenders wrongfully seized homes.        ', u'\n                    Now the regulatory spotlight is swinging from mortgages to credit cards. The problems in credit card lawsuits play out in the shadows, judges say. That is because unlike in foreclosure cases, borrowers sued over credit card debt rarely show up to defend themselves. As a result, more than 95 percent of lawsuits result in a default judgment, an automatic victory for the lender.        ', u'\n                    Armed with a default judgment, lenders can garnish a consumer\u2019s wages or freeze bank accounts to get their money back.        ', u'\n                    Sometimes borrowers do not even realize that they have been sued until a lender wins a default judgment, consumer lawyers say. The situation arises, consumer lawyers say, when lenders claim to serve borrowers with notice of a suit, as they are required to do under the law, but do not follow through. The practice, called \u201csewer service,\u201d is rampant across the country, the consumer lawyers say. Ms. Harris accused JPMorgan of sewer service in her lawsuit.        ', u'\n                    Sonia Caro, 62, who lives in Brooklyn, said she had no idea that ', u' was suing her over credit card debt until the lender won a $2,039.43 judgment against her in 2010.        ', u'\n                    Ms. Caro, who fell behind on her credit cards after multiple sclerosis forced her to stop working, said that she was shocked. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. Faced with the staggering bill, Ms. Caro said she was devastated. \u201cIt felt so bad.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Capital One did not return calls for comment.

Loeb and John Paulson, the politicians Nicolas Sarkozy and Leon Panetta, and the entertainers Oliver Stone and Al Pacino.

And this being Sin City, it is, perhaps above all else, a good time.

The ascent of SALT, and Mr. Scaramucci, comes in a challenging time for hedge funds, which are expensive investment vehicles that promise outsize returns in up and down markets. The explosive growth experienced by the industry a decade ago has plateaued. For four consecutive years, the average hedge fund has failed to beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.        ', u'\n                    Despite the weak performance, hedge funds, which have a total of about $2.5 trillion in assets, are still attracting money, taking in $15.2 billion in the first quarter of this year, according to Hedge Fund Research.        ', u'\n                    The SALT crowd can thank the Federal Reserve\u2019s persistent near-zero interest rate policy for their continued good fortune. Managers are also seeing money flood into debt-trading strategies as the world\u2019s largest banks have retrenched from those risky investments under greater regulation.

It also oversees another roughly $3 billion in a business that advises pensions and other large institutions on hedge-fund-manager selection.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Scaramucci has built SkyBridge on the belief that hedge funds are not just the domain of giant pension funds and the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans.

', u'\n                    In recent days, according to officials briefed on the matter, Rust Consulting issued nearly 100,000 checks for less than the homeowners were owed. The mistake potentially cheated consumers out of millions of dollars they were owed under a deal reached between the government and the nation\u2019s biggest banks.        ', u'\n                    Federal regulators ordered Rust to fix its mistake. And in a statement, Rust said late Wednesday that it had \u201ccorrected the error and plans to mail supplemental checks to affected borrowers as soon as May 17.\u201d It attributed the mistake to a \u201cclerical error.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But the developments cast another harsh spotlight on Rust, which had been selected as the distributor of checks for the $3.6 billion settlement deal that regulators struck with the banks. The continued problems with Rust also raised questions about the government\u2019s oversight of the firm and the wisdom of hiring it in the first place.        ', u'\n                    What\u2019s more, some homeowners complain the problem is broader than Rust has acknowledged. Jennifer Lawson, whose husband is on active duty with the Navy, said she was stunned when she received a check on April 19 for $600. Under the terms of the settlement deal, Ms. Lawson expected thousands of dollars in compensation for her foreclosure.        ', u'\n                    \u201cFirst we are wrongfully tossed out of our home while serving this country and then we get basically no money,\u201d Ms. Lawson said.

Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, who has opened an investigation into problems with the settlement, including the use of Rust.        ', u'\n                    With more than 50 federal contracts to its name, and its own political action committee spreading campaign donations across Washington, Rust has become a favored middleman for class-action lawsuits and government settlements.        ', u'\n                    In the foreclosure settlement case, in which regulators accused 13 lenders of wrongful evictions and other abuses, Rust appeared to be the logical choice. In fact, when executives from some banks suggested a different consulting firm for the foreclosure settlement, regulators balked, according to people briefed on the matter. The regulators instead suggested that the banks hire Rust.        ', u'\n                    But problems emerged soon after the settlement was announced in January. The consulting firm, officials said, was initially slow to alert borrowers to expected payments. Then, the officials say, Rust delayed the checks for weeks as it struggled to gear up for the payments.        ', u'\n                    Once Rust issued the first round of checks in April, it failed to move money into the bank account used for the settlement. The decision prevented some homeowners from cashing their checks.        ', u'\n                    Rust played down the mistake at first, saying in a private e-mail to banks that the \u201cperceived issues\u201d with a handful of checks lack \u201cmerit,\u201d according to a copy of the e-mail reviewed by The New York Times.        ', u'\n                    But, in effect, the checks bounced. And after the incident, Rust lost significant credibility with the regulators, officials said.        ', u'\n                    More recently, homeowners have complained about clerical errors at Rust, problems like checks sent to the wrong addresses or issued to deceased borrowers.        ', u'\n                    Norma Gammon, 54, said she thought things could not get much worse after her home in Evansville, Ind., was sold at foreclosure auction in June. But then she started dealing with Rust. After contacting Rust at least six times to update her address, Ms. Gammon said, she learned that the firm had sent the check to her foreclosed property. To receive another payment, Ms. Gammon has to fill out a new form. But Rust says the form has been sent three times, apparently to the wrong address.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating that I just want to cry,\u201d she said.        ', u'\n                    The firm\u2019s latest mistake \u2014 sending out checks in the wrong amounts \u2014 could also prove difficult to remedy.        ', u'\n                    The problem stems from last week, when Rust issued checks to customers of ', u' and ', u'. Unlike the other banks involved in the settlement, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley\u2019s foreclosures were not subjected to a long independent assessment by outside auditors. As such, the banks agreed to pay some of its customers an extra sum.        ', u'\n                    But Rust, according to the officials briefed on the matter, failed to follow the payout plan. Instead, it issued checks to customers of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley based on a metric adopted by the 11 other banks, including ', u' and ', u'.        ', u'\n                    The misstep deprived some homeowners of thousands of dollars.

The agency is also investigating whether the lenders dupe retirees into signing up for the loans by disguising the soaring interest rates, the people said.        ', u'\n                    As the baby boomer generation heads toward retirement and a growing number of older Americans shoulder crippling debt burdens, the pension advance firms are aggressively courting military veterans, teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with a hard-to-resist pitch: convert tomorrow\u2019s pension income into hard cash.

Given Sterling Cooper\u2019s existing 1.5 million outstanding shares, that would have valued the agency at $17.1 million \u2014 or about $114.4 million in today\u2019s dollars.        ', u'\n                    In the episode, Sterling Cooper eventually improved its position, winning a higher proposed price of $11 a share. That would have valued the agency at $20.9 million, or $139.8 million today.        ', u'\n                    By May 1968, when the episode is set, seven ad agencies had held initial stock offerings, according to ', u'. Among them were Wells Rich Greene and Papert, Koenig, Lois.        ', u'\n                    Over all, 21 agencies went public from 1962 to 1973, according to ', u' by Andrew von Nordenflycht, a business professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia. Among them were major shops like Doyle Dane Bernbach and Ogilvy & Mather, the latter of which ', u' among its shareholders.

Services companies like ad agencies became hot commodities, playing off the allure of Madison Avenue and its mad admen.        ', u'\n                    The trough wasn\u2019t restricted to the big names. As the banker (whose name or firm affiliation is never identified) notes in the \u201cMad Men\u201d episode, there was precedent for small advertising agencies going public. ', u' on Feb. 13, 1968, detailed the I.P.O. of Adams Dana Silverstein, then the tiniest firm in the industry to begin trading publicly.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe made our decision to go public \u2014 a gutsy one \u2014 six months after we started and our reason was that we wanted to build a damn good agency and staff,\u201d D. W. Silverstein, the firm\u2019s president, told The Times then.        ', u'\n                    Yet the bubble eventually burst, violently. Of the 21 agencies that had held I.P.O.\u2019s, two failed and six had gone private by 1978, according to Professor von Nordenflycht.        ', u'\n                    Today, the advertising concerns that remain publicly traded are largely giant conglomerates like Omnicom and WPP, which own scores of smaller shops and have largely thrived. A number of small digital advertising firms went public in the late 1990s, only to sputter in the wake of the dot-com bust.        ', u'\n                    Why? Big firms can spread out their risks among a number of their holdings, making their earnings less volatile.        ', u'\n                    And then consider Sterling Cooper. News that Jaguar had left as a client prompted an apoplectic fit by the junior partner Pete Campbell, and with good reason: Don\u2019s summary firing of the car company took away a significant amount of revenue. It wasn\u2019t the first time the firm had suffered from a client departure; Lucky Strike\u2019s exit was chief among them. (At the end of the third season, the cigarette maker brought in $24 million in billings. Vicks Chemical, which was gone as of Sunday\u2019s episode, was worth $9 million.)        ', u'\n                    And as service businesses, ad agencies are at the mercy of client fees rolling in, a lumpy operating model that wins little favor among many investors. The same problem prompted investment banks like Lazard and Evercore Partners to add steady-revenue businesses like asset management for smoother earnings.        ', u'\n                    Adams Dana Silverstein\u2019s very reason for going public proves the point. The 1968 article noted that the idea came after the agency, founded two years earlier, had just lost its first account.

So we said, \u2018Why not go public?\u2019\xa0\u201d        ', u'\n                    As Professor von Nordenflycht notes, the ad industry of the time wasn\u2019t sitting on particularly notable growth or profitability during the early 1960s.        ', u'\n                    And the firms taking these agencies public weren\u2019t always of the highest caliber. Bert Cooper, a name partner, sniffs that the banker pitching Sterling Cooper \u2014 who was earlier shown furiously punching an adding machine \u2014 conducted only 20 minutes of analysis.        ', u'\n                    His dismissive reply to the banker\u2019s preliminary estimate hinted of the army of drones seeking business: \u201cI can\u2019t take this to the rest of partners, but I can take it to other underwriters.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Adams Dana Silverstein was taken public by the Hancock Securities Corporation, which was eventually expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers in 1972, according to ', u'.

', u'\n                    Fiat and the union workers\u2019 health care trust are fighting over that yawning gulf in a court in Delaware, arguing over buyout arrangements struck in the depths of the financial crisis when Chrysler was arguably worthless. It\u2019s a lesson in how deals struck hastily in the heat of crisis can come back to haunt in unexpected ways.        ', u'\n                    In 2009, Steven Rattner and his team at the Treasury Department ably brokered what could only be described as a prayer. Chrysler would be thrown into bankruptcy. Afterward, Fiat would own 20 percent, the Treasury Department would get 10 percent, and the Canadian government, 2 percent. The remaining 68 percent of Chrysler was given to the union workers\u2019 health care trust, formed to pay out Chrysler health care benefits to retirees. In addition to a majority ownership of Chrysler, the trust was also given a $4.59 billion note from Chrysler to eliminate the company\u2019s obligation to provide any further health benefits to retirees.        ', u'\n                    The deal was viewed as a bargain for a federal government desperate to save the automaker. At the time, Chrysler was a loser that most thought could not be saved. There were no buyers other than Fiat. And so the government was happy to give Fiat control, even though the Italian company had only a 20 percent stake. For this, Fiat paid nothing, instead offering its expertise.        ', u'\n                    As for the health care trust, the Treasury Department used the bankruptcy process to jump it ahead in priority. In a normal bankruptcy, the trust would most likely have been left with nothing. Instead, the government arranged for the trust to receive more than it otherwise would and more than almost all of Chrysler\u2019s creditors. The reason was to ensure employee peace. The government could do this because it was the only lender in town, putting up $8.5 billion of taxpayer money in the bankruptcy alone.        ', u'\n                    If it succeeded with Chrysler, Fiat wanted a clear path to acquire all of the company. So, Fiat negotiated an option to acquire 40 percent of the interests held by the health care trust and all of the interests held by the government. Starting in July 2012, the Italian company was allowed to purchase up to 20 percent of these covered interests every six months. Fiat also negotiated a series of arrangements that allowed it to increase its stake by making improvements to Chrysler.        ', u'\n                    These deals, which were cut in dark times, are coming back to bite.        ', u'\n                    Chrysler has since recovered and is now profitable. In the gloomy European market, Fiat is struggling.        ', u'\n                    To save Fiat, Mr. Marchionne wants to put the two automakers together. In 2011, Fiat took a step in this direction by purchasing the stakes held by the United States and Canadian governments for $640 million.        ', u'\n                    Now, it\u2019s the turn of the U.A.W.\u2019s health care trust, known as the voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA. But with real money at stake this time, the parties are ready to fight Detroit-style.        ', u'\n                    Last fall, Fiat exercised its option to buy 3.3 percent of Chrysler from the trust. Fiat calculated the price from the option agreement, and came to $139.7 million, valuing all of Chrysler at about $4.2 billion.        ', u'\n                    VEBA protested, asserting that Fiat misread the agreement. According to the trust, Fiat\u2019s calculations have a number of flaws, which means that this purchase should be at least $342 million and perhaps more, valuing Chrysler at more than $10 billion.        ', u'\n                    That means there is a $6 billion difference in value arising from each side\u2019s interpretation of the agreement.        ', u'\n                    The parties are litigating this gap, and the future of Mr. Marchionne\u2019s vision for Chrysler hangs in the balance. If the Delaware court rules for Fiat, Mr. Marchionne will continue to build his stake in Chrysler with an eye toward a buyout of the company.        ', u'\n                    If the court finds for VEBA, however, Mr. Marchionne may halt his pursuit, unable to find the billions to pay the trust. Still, at a minimum, it would mean billions more for Chrysler\u2019s retirees.        ', u'\n                    There is some irony in the dispute, given that the goal of the options was to get a value of what Chrysler was worth and avoid disputes.        ', u'\n                    But there is a big hole in the language spelling out how the option price works. The health care trust is claiming that the value of Chrysler should be calculated without counting the $4.5 billion note issued to it by the company. Fiat disputes this because the note reduces the value of Chrysler by about $4.5 billion.        ', u'\n                    Why the lawyers didn\u2019t specifically address this in the contract is a mystery. Whatever the reason, the lawyers used a term that talked about \u201cdebt for borrowed money,\u201d and health care trust argues that the note wasn\u2019t for money and so should be excluded.        ', u'\n                    Perhaps we should call it a $4.5 billion drafting error.        ', u'\n                    At a hearing before the Delaware judge a few weeks ago, VEBA also adopted another strategy \u2014 stall. The health care trust threw up all sorts of problems with the purchase price calculation, and also said a trial was needed.        ', u'\n                    The strategy is simple. The longer the delay, the more likely that Mr. Marchionne will cave and come to the negotiating table, paying more money.        ', u'\n                    As for those legal arguments and the dispute over the purchase price language, they highlight how small details can prove to be very important. Billions of dollars now turn on a single phrase and other items the lawyers didn\u2019t define or include in the contract.        ', u'\n                    This is where the fate of Chrysler and the health care trust sit as they await guidance from the Delaware court.        ', u'\n                    VEBA is underfunded by billions of dollars. It needs the money. (Coincidentally, the 2009 arrangements capped the trust\u2019s profits from Chrysler at about $4.5 billion, turning the rest over to the government. The government sold that right in 2011 to Fiat for $75 million. So, the maximum profit the trust can get from its Chrysler stake is $4.5 billion).        ', u'\n                    The union and the trust know that Fiat wants to deal, but things may not be so rosy in the future. Both Chrysler and Fiat face pressure to bring on new models from competitors. And remember, this deal affects only 40 percent of the health care trust\u2019s share. The rest still needs to be bought out, and the trust doesn\u2019t have to sell. The trust will use this additional leverage to aim for that $4.5 billion, because anything else goes back to Fiat.        ', u'\n                    It is ripe territory for a deal \u2014 if only a price can be agreed upon.

', u'\n                    Under the terms of the settlement, banks have to abide by 304 servicing standards, like notifying homeowners of missing documents within five days of receiving a loan modification and providing borrowers with a single point of contact.

Since October 2012, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office has documented 210 separate violations involving Wells Fargo and 129 involving Bank of America.        ', u'\n                    The move by Mr. Schneiderman is the first time that an attorney general has readied a lawsuit against one of the five participating banks on charges related to the settlement, which was aimed at halting the housing market\u2019s downward slump and doling out relief to homeowners in foreclosure.        ', u'\n                    More attorneys general could follow Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s lead. Last week, ', u', the Massachusetts attorney general, also sent a letter to Joseph A. Smith, the settlement monitor, outlining \u201crecurring issues\u201d with mortgage servicers, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The New York Times.

', u'\n                    The settlement emerged from an investigation into mortgage servicing by all 50 state attorneys general that began in 2010 after revelations emerged that banks had churned through foreclosures using robosigned documents, legal paperwork that was seldom reviewed for accuracy.        ', u'\n                    After the deal was reached in February 2012, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office began receiving a deluge of complaints from housing counselors across the state.

The committee has 21 days to decide whether to initiate a lawsuit, or whether Mr. Schneiderman will pursue the action alone.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America and Wells Fargo said on Monday that they would take steps to handle the issues raised.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThrough March we have provided relief for more than 10,000 New York homeowners through the National Mortgage Settlement, totaling more than $1 billion,\u201d said Richard G.

Before the settlement, housing counselors said that homeowners were ensnared in a bureaucratic maze when seeking foreclosure relief. Some borrowers were asked for the same document multiple times, while others were shuttled from one representative to another. As their applications for relief languished, housing counselors said, borrowers accrued fresh costs, like late fees and property taxes, that aggravated their distress.

', u'\n                    Now the multibillion-dollar claims the institutions had against each other will be canceled out. Under the agreement, Bank of America will pay $1.6 billion in cash to MBIA, and will lend the firm another $500 million. It also acquired warrants that, if exercised, would give the bank a 4.9 percent stake in the insurer. In addition, the bank will surrender to MBIA about $130 million in MBIA bonds.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America said the agreement would reduce its previously announced first quarter after-tax profits by $1.1 billion, or 10 cents a share, but would improve its capital position.

Bank of America shares surged 64 cents, or 5 percent, to $12.88.        ', u'\n                    Before the settlement, it appeared that within weeks the insurer would owe as much as $3 billion to Merrill Lynch stemming from credit-default swaps issued by MBIA concerning commercial real estate transactions.        ', u'\n                    MBIA Corporation had met earlier obligations by borrowing money from National, the municipal bond part of the company.        ', u'\n                    But Benjamin Lawsky, the New York State financial services superintendent, refused to allow further loans, and it was expected that MBIA Corporation might be put into receivership before it had to pay Merrill Lynch.        ', u'\n                    In an interview, Mr. Lawsky said negotiations had been going on for more than a year, but accelerated in the last couple of weeks. \u201cThere was a way to get to yes because everyone had claims on everyone else,\u201d he said. The agreement, he said \u201cresolves significant exposure and expensive litigation for Bank of America, while also giving MBIA a path forward.\u201d        ', u'\n                    MBIA originally insured municipal bonds, a profitable business because few such bonds ever defaulted and municipalities buying the insurance would get AAA ratings on their bonds, saving them more in interest payments than the insurance cost because many muni bond investors were very risk-averse.        ', u'\n                    It later expanded into insuring securitizations and writing credit-default swaps, businesses in which the purchasers were more sophisticated. When the financial crisis struck, it became clear that the company had taken some very bad risks.        ', u'\n                    In 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, which later was folded into the Department of Financial Services, approved a decision by MBIA to split into the two companies. Banks and hedge funds that owned securities insured by MBIA went to court to try to reverse the split. In March, MBIA prevailed in one of those suits, as Justice Barbara R. Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the insurance department had wide latitude to approve the split with or without much investigation.        ', u'\n                    She cited a deposition by Michael Moriarty, the then-deputy superintendent of the department, who said \u201cthe department did not, nor do they usually, verify the financial condition of a company.\u201d Since that was the policy, the judge concluded she had no authority to question it, even if some information provided by the company was false.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America had vowed to appeal that decision, raising the possibility that an appellate court would order a trial that could be embarrassing to the state regulator. Under the settlement, the bank will drop that appeal.        ', u'\n                    Some MBIA legal disputes remain.

MBIA is also pursuing complaints against ResCap, a mortgage company previously owned by ', u'\u2019 finance arm, and against ', u', the Swiss bank. Settlement of those disputes potentially could bring in more than $500 million to MBIA.        ', u'\n                    Another suit against the MBIA split was filed by hedge funds that feared their insurance claims would not be honored. That suit is still pending, but the agreement would make it harder to pursue since all the information the bank obtained in disclosure from MBIA would be returned to the insurer.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America had bought the bonds in an effort to frustrate MBIA\u2019s effort to change their terms. By turning over the bonds to the insurer, it now seems likely MBIA can change the terms. The expectation is that MBIA will eventually resell the bonds to investors, providing cash for the company.        ', u'\n                    The money provided by Bank of America will largely be used to repay the loans National made to MBIA Corporation, solidifying National\u2019s finances.

His company, Teledyne, became a remarkably successful and huge conglomerate, with an assortment of related \u2014 and unrelated \u2014 businesses. Like Mr. Buffett, Mr. Singleton was a modest man with a rare sense of rationality. He didn\u2019t pay his shareholders dividends; he was convinced he could allocate the money more profitably. And he was right more often than not.

He decided that Teledyne had become too big and unwieldy for a single manager to effectively oversee and expand.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s a narrative that has been speculated about for years when it comes to Mr. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, the fifth largest company in the world, judged by market value.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Singleton\u2019s name was invoked by Douglas A.

', u'\n                    After explaining the story of Mr. Singleton, whom Mr. Buffett long admired, Mr. Kass then asked: \u201cWhat is the advisability of restructuring Berkshire into separately traded companies organized along business lines?\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Buffett, who has described Berkshire as his \u201cpainting,\u201d paused briefly.

', u'\n                    \u201cBreaking them up into several companies I\u2019m convinced would create a poorer result,\u201d Mr. Buffett insisted, while praising Mr. Singleton as an investor. Charles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, had this to say about Mr. Singleton: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should get into your head, just because he is a genius, he did it better than us.\u201d (Mr. Munger knew Mr. Singleton personally.)        ', u'\n                    But Mr. Munger quickly also acknowledged a truism of business: \u201cYou look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good.

Maybe we have a better system.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The question, of course, is how much is \u201ca little better\u201d?

', u'\n                    Part of Mr. Buffett\u2019s bet is that Berkshire\u2019s value and advantage now lie in its size and scale. He believes that in flat or down markets, Berkshire will be able to outperform others because it can take advantage of opportunities \u2014 with its huge cash pile \u2014 that others cannot.

', u'\n                    Perhaps more important, Mr. Buffett suggested that it did not matter whether he was chief executive for those opportunities to exist. Panicked sellers are calling for money, not to be his friend.

The latest call to action came on Friday from Daniel K. Tarullo, a governor at the Federal Reserve, an agency that plays a crucial role in shaping new banking rules.        ', u'\n                    In a speech before the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, he described a tough, new measure that could be squarely aimed at large Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Tarullo may have chosen an opportune time to make his case.        ', u'\n                    His speech comes amid increasing calls to do more to deal with the so-called too-big-to-fail issue. This holds that some financial institutions are so big that, if they were to collapse, they would damage the rest of the financial system, and weigh on the economy.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Tarullo said much had been done to make the financial system safer, through the two main overhauls that came after the crisis. Those are the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010, and the internationally agreed bank regulations known as Basel III. In particular, these initiatives have made banks hold more capital, a part of a bank\u2019s balance sheet that can serve as a buffer against losses. Before the crash of 2008, banks had insufficient capital, which stoked the fears that swept the global financial system. Taxpayers had to step in and provide new capital as part of efforts to restore confidence.        ', u'\n                    Still, Mr. Tarullo sees remaining areas of concern. He focused on the markets where Wall Street banks borrow huge sums of money for short periods. They use their borrowings in these so-called wholesale markets to then buy assets. But in times of stress, like 2008, these markets can dry up. Deprived of their lifeblood, banks rush to sell off the assets they bought with their wholesale borrowings, which can set off a wider collapse.        ', u'\n                    \u201cRelatively little has been done to change the structure of wholesale funding markets so as to make them less susceptible to damaging runs,\u201d he said in the speech.        ', u'\n                    To make the system safer, Mr. Tarullo floated an idea that could affect banks that make heavy use of wholesale markets. His idea is to require such banks to hold extra capital. How much extra would depend on how flush a bank\u2019s balance sheet is. Such a program is more aimed at the major Wall Street institutions, while leaving regional lenders and even large consumer-oriented banks like Wells Fargo largely unscathed.        ', u'\n                    Under the current rules, large banks have to hold a pool of assets they can theoretically sell quickly to cover any outflows that occur in a turbulent period in the markets. Under Mr. Tarullo\u2019s idea, the larger this pool, the less extra capital they would have to hold to cover the risk present in wholesale markets.        ', u'\n                    In reality, however, banks would probably do less wholesale borrowing to avoid the tougher capital requirements. In turn, that might prompt them to shrink their overall size, and therefore, not be so big as to require a government bailout if they failed.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe would do the American public a fundamental disservice were we to declare victory without tackling the structural weaknesses of short-term wholesale funding markets, both in general and as they affect the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 problem,\u201d Mr. Tarullo said.        ', u'\n                    The speech, which called for other changes to toughen regulation, follows a recently introduced bill that took aim at large banks.        ', u'\n                    The legislation, from Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, would subject the biggest banks to much higher capital requirements than smaller banks. If the bill is passed, many large banks would probably choose to divest themselves of assets to shrink to a size where they would not be required to hold higher amounts of capital.        ', u'\n                    The bill has already generated fierce objections from the financial industry. Its critics said the capital increases would force banks to cut back on their lending, and they argued that large banks provide unique benefits to the economy.        ', u'\n                    Political analysts have said that the Brown-Vitter bill has little chance of passing, but the measure has reignited a conversation about what to do about banks whose failure could weaken the broader financial system.        ', u'\n                    Regulators like the Federal Reserve, however, do not have to wait for Congress to pass legislation to introduce new measures. The Dodd-Frank Act gave regulators substantial freedom to impose measures to strengthen the system on their own.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Tarullo mentioned that leeway in this speech on Friday. The Fed could use that authority to push forward on the measure to raise capital requirements for firms that make big use of wholesale debt markets. And it could impose  another notable measure mentioned by Mr. Tarullo.        ', u'\n                    It involves something called the leverage ratio. This measures capital as a percentage of assets. It differs from other regulatory capital ratios in that it doesn\u2019t adjust the assets for their perceived riskiness. Some analysts say they believe the \u201crisk-based\u201d approach is flawed and can lead a bank to hold too little capital.        ', u'\n                    They say the leverage ratio is a safer measure of capital because it doesn\u2019t treat some assets as less risky than others. Mr. Tarullo said the Fed might set a higher leverage ratio.        ', u'\n                    Despite this call, some analysts said that Mr. Tarullo did not appear to be advocating for the much higher capital levels envisioned in the Brown-Vitter bill. The legislation requires banks with over $500 billion to have capital that is equivalent to 15 percent of their assets.        ', u'\n                    \u201cHe\u2019s definitely not calling for a 15 percent leverage ratio like Brown-Vitter,\u201d said Patrick Sims, a director at Hamilton Place Strategies, a policy firm that has aired objections to some of the contents in the senators\u2019 bill.

More than 18,000 shareholders flock to Omaha in early May every year, hoping to listen to what one of the country\u2019s most celebrated investors has to say.        ', u'\n                    Most years, shareholders have asked a wide range of largely softball questions, from the billionaire\u2019s thoughts on the global economy to his religious beliefs.        ', u'\n                    But Mr. Buffett has tried to toughen up the questioning at the annual meeting, a 180-degree turn from what the majority of publicly traded companies seek to do. He has asked reporters, including one from The New York Times, and analysts to ask tougher questions.        ', u'\n                    Inviting Mr. Kass, 64, is perhaps the boldest move yet. The hedge fund manager is best known for his frequently contrarian positions, often on display in appearances on television shows about business and in his column on ', u'.

Since beginning his research, manager Mr. Kass has found a number of similarities with Mr. Buffett. For example, both have been treated for prostate cancer, and both once collected discarded horse-racing tickets at tracks in their younger days.

Mr. Buffett, 82, is likely to reiterate that his company \u2014 a huge conglomerate that counts railroads, private jets and running shoes among its holdings \u2014 has a succession plan in place for when he finally hangs up his investor\u2019s hat. (He\u2019s unlikely to say who will succeed him as chief executive.)        ', u'\n                    He will also most likely discuss his hunger to strike more big deals, one of his signature corporate moves.

(In Philadelphia, a similar proposal could not overcome a ', u' by the mayor.) Businesses with at least six employees have to provide one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours an employee works, up to 40 hours a year, as well as protect the employee\u2019s job. Companies with five or fewer employees must offer the same amount of unpaid, job-protected time off. An employee must work at least 240 hours before becoming eligible. In Portland, the law takes effect in January.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Fuentes said that he already offered paid time off to all of his employees (the number fluctuates between five and seven). They can use the time for any purpose, he said, and he has found that offering the time has added just 1 percent to his total labor expense. \u201cThe costs are pretty minimal,\u201d he said, \u201cand, talking with other businesses in Portland doing the same thing, our costs are line with theirs.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Because Mr. Fuentes has a paid time-off policy that is at least as generous as what the city will soon require for sick leave, he will not be affected by the new law. But whether a business owner supports the law does not necessarily turn on how much strain the law will put on the company. Family Forward Oregon also tried to press Lisa Schroeder, owner of ', u' into service for paid sick leave. Ms. Schroeder also offers paid time off and may have seemed a promising candidate to be a public face for the measure, since she is well known for her liberal views on other issues.

Ms. Kitchin provides paid time off for her three full-time workers, but not for her crew of part-timers, which this year has ranged from one to three \u2014 she said she wasn\u2019t sure whether the law would require her to offer paid leave.

It tracks them by pay period, or by month, which adds to the cost.        ', u'\n                    \u201cBy itself, it\u2019s not the end of the world. But do you know how many other things there are like this?

If the employee is convicted or subject to other sanctions, that compensation will not be paid. Mr. Cohen compared the new clawback rule to those that the large banks instituted after the financial crisis under pressure from regulators.

At Manassas, the kids knew that I was running my own business, and had a family and my own kids at home, but they saw me working hard every day, volunteering at the school to be their coach. The kids on the team knew that I cared about them and worked hard for them, and as a result, they worked hard for me.

', u'\n                    If the bankers who blew up the financial world had been held accountable, the popular fury that fuels this bill would have dissipated by now.

', u'\n                    Now, we will see whether the bill is simply a barbaric yawp of anger at the big banks or something with actual force. It probably won\u2019t get passed, but its underlying premise cannot be dislodged from the Washington conversation.        ', u'\n                    The Brown-Vitter bill calls for the banks with more than $500 billion in assets \u2014 I\u2019m looking at you, ', u', ', u', ', u', ', u', ', u' and ', u' \u2014 to have capital reserves of 15 percent. That\u2019s a much higher standard than exists today, especially because the current requirements have weak definitions of capital and total asset size.        ', u'\n                    The banks have rounded up a bunch of critics, led by the likes of the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and the lobbying firm Hamilton Place Strategies, the volume of their lamentations most likely in direct proportion to the hourly rate they bill their clients. They invoke terrifying, talismanic statements: the bill is a \u201cpunishment\u201d to big banks. It is simplistic, impossible, will render American banks \u201cuncompetitive,\u201d lead to financial crises and probably cause tooth decay.        ', u'\n                    This na\xefve bill would force the giant banks to raise too much capital and would hurt the economy as the companies were forced to shrink or break up. Standard & Poor\u2019s is one of the observers warning of a financial crisis. And who better to know than the people who brought us the last one?        ', u'\n                    Goldman Sachs and S.& P. estimate the big banks might be forced to raise $1 trillion or more. That\u2019s a lot, so much that the leviathans\u2019 agents cry out that they couldn\u2019t sell that much stock. But they don\u2019t have to raise it all at once.

', u'\n                    In putting that argument forward, they don\u2019t realize they make Senator Brown\u2019s and Senator Vitter\u2019s case for them. If investors are so terrified of the big banks that they won\u2019t buy their stock, that\u2019s a terrific problem. Most of the big banks trade below their net worth, an indication that investors don\u2019t trust them. Brown-Vitter might actually help banks by restoring that trust.        ', u'\n                    The Brown-Vitter bill serves as a good time to remind defenders of big banks what bank \u201ccapital\u201d is. As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig have pointed out in their ', u' \u201cThe Bankers\u2019 New Clothes,\u201d capital is not a rainy-day fund. It\u2019s not stored away in a vault somewhere, never to be touched. Capital \u2014 the rest of us know it as \u201cequity,\u201d like the down payment on a house \u2014 is simply money that absorbs losses. The more money a bank raises from shareholders, the more profit it keeps on hand, the less it has to borrow and the more solid it is. The bank can still lend that money. And if JPMorgan Chase doesn\u2019t lend to some small business, perhaps a regional or community bank will.        ', u'\n                    There might be some trade-offs to higher capital requirements, but we know there are costs to lower ones: financial crises. Some try to argue that the banks faced a liquidity crisis in 2008, what we call a run on the bank. Yes, that was true in the autumn of 2008. But the crisis didn\u2019t start then. It started in the late summer of 2007. If the banks had been more solidly capitalized, there would have been fewer panicked investors.        ', u'\n                    Banks desire as little capital as they can get away with. It\u2019s easier to make higher returns on equity with greater debt. Often management is paid in stock. But society as a whole doesn\u2019t benefit from banks that are running with too much leverage. They collapse.        ', u'\n                    So, it is better to have higher equity capital. But Brown-Vitter doesn\u2019t go far enough. The bill\u2019s definition of equity could be tighter. It still contains bookkeeping entries called intangible assets and deferred tax assets, which don\u2019t absorb losses.        ', u'\n                    But, gratifyingly, Brown-Vitter does tighten up the definition of assets. Capital is the numerator and assets are the denominator. Both need to be made as solid and trustworthy \u2014 and resistant to manipulation by banks or regulatory capture \u2014 as they can be. When calculating assets, Brown-Vitter tightens up rules on things like how the banks measure their exposure to derivatives.

They are loans with a difference, however.\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe loans are essentially payments to lure the advisers \u2014 and presumably many of their clients \u2014 to the firm and keep them there.

', u'\n                    There is a cost to this practice. The ', u' requires brokerage firms to hold a significant amount of capital, one dollar for each dollar lent, to protect against loan losses.

Segregating these loans allows the bank to set aside just 8 cents for every dollar lent, a much lower capital cost than its rivals ', u' and ', u' pay. Wells says it keeps all these loans at its broker-dealer, taking a higher capital charge. Bank of America keeps some at its broker-dealer and some in a unit that allows it to set aside less capital. An arbitration case in Tampa, Fla., has opened a window on the different choices that financial firms make about where to house virtually identical assets and how those decisions can reduce a firm\u2019s capital burden. Such calls \u2014 rarely disclosed publicly \u2014 have become more important since the financial crisis as regulators have pushed banks to hold more capital to protect against potential losses.

Wall Street executives with knowledge of the loan structures, who were not authorized to speak on the record, suggested that some banks have not moved the loans outside of the broker-dealer because doing so might draw regulatory scrutiny and would require these banks to rewrite thousands of client contracts.        ', u'\n                    Details about Morgan Stanley\u2019s arrangement emerged in a recent dispute involving a former financial adviser. The broker, James Eastman, 59, filed an arbitration claim against the bank after he left in 2010, arguing defamation of character and wrongful dismissal. He sought to have his loans from the bank forgiven, something Morgan Stanley was unwilling to do.        ', u'\n                    After working at Citigroup for years, Mr. Eastman became part of Morgan Stanley after the two firms combined their brokerage operations.        ', u'\n                    He ended up with two loans. The first was made in 2001, when he started at Citigroup, and it was valued at $942,532. It was forgivable over 10 years, and then subsequently extended. In 2009, he received another loan, valued at $214,648, to encourage him to stay through the merger. Mr. Eastman left the company in 2010, owing roughly $400,000 on the two loans, according to his lawyer, Chris Vernon.        ', u'\n                    Typically a broker gets a loan that covers several years and is required to pay interest on it. The broker repays the loan using earnings from a parallel bonus pool, assuming certain performance targets are met. If they are not, or the broker bolts to another firm, the broker may be required to pay the loan back.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Vernon says he was concerned that the entity holding Mr. Eastman\u2019s loans was something called Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, and not the brokerage business, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. He says he did not want a third party coming after his client later, so he argued that Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, not Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, should be a party to the arbitration case. As part of the arbitration, Jeffrey Gelfand, the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley\u2019s wealth management business, was called to testify.        ', u'\n                    Under oath, Mr. Gelfand explained that Morgan Stanley had always housed broker loans outside its broker-dealer. The current holding company, he said, was created in 2009, just weeks before the announcement that Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were combining their wealth management operations.        ', u'\n                    \u201cHaving them away from the broker-dealer just allows us to minimize the regulatory capital associated with them and operate the broker-dealer more efficiently,\u201d he explained to the three arbiters hearing his claim.        ', u'\n                    He said Morgan Stanley financed its broker-dealer \u201cwell in excess of the minimum capital requirement,\u201d so leaving the loans there might not necessarily affect how much capital the bank\u2019s broker-dealer has, but it \u201creduces the requirement if that was important at any point in time.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The arbitration was bittersweet for Mr. Eastman. While he received a lesson in Wall Street capital decisions, the arbitration panel denied Mr. Eastman\u2019s claims in March and ordered him to pay back roughly $200,000 of the $400,000 he owed the bank. As well, the panel granted his motion to dismiss Morgan Stanley Smith Barney as a party on his two loans.

Some critics question its resolve to scale back the role of Fannie and Freddie, which received one of the biggest bailouts of the financial crisis. They say Mr. Watt\u2019s nomination looks like tactical maneuvering, designed in part to placate progressives in Congress who say the president has done too little to help homeowners.

The nonpartisan ', u' released a study showing that reducing the amounts borrowers owe could actually save taxpayers money by reducing the chance underwater homeowners would default and end up in foreclosure, thus causing losses to Fannie and Freddie, which own or guarantee more than half of all residential mortgages. But other analyses suggest that the approach is not a silver bullet. About one-third of borrowers who had their mortgage balances reduced by more than 20 percent went back into default within two years, according to a study by ', u'.

', u'\n                    And while analysts expect the results to show a sharp decline from last year\u2019s first quarter, in part because of disruptions in its Nigerian gas operations, many experts say Shell may eventually show big benefits from its natural gas emphasis.        ', u'\n                    Increasingly, to make gas a global commodity, companies supercool it into a liquid form for transport on specialized ships. Shell has already invested about $40 billion in liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., production plants, storage terminals and related systems, and plans to continue pumping money into that business.        ', u'\n                    Shell now has about 7 percent of the world L.N.G. business, with ambitions to more than double that share through new projects and acquisitions. Last year, L.N.G. and related businesses earned Shell $9.4 billion of its $25.1 billion in profit.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe are in the lead, and we want to stay in the lead,\u201d Andrew Brown, Shell\u2019s head of international exploration and production, said in a mid-April interview. Mr. Brown said Shell expected global demand for L.N.G. to grow rapidly in the coming years, doubling by 2025 to about 500 million tons a year, the equivalent of about 4.5 billion barrels of ', u', making it by far the fastest-growing fuel.        ', u'\n                    The main reason for the anticipated growth is that natural gas is abundant. And because of the U.S shale gas boom, it has become relatively cheap \u2014 especially in North America, where prices lately have been in the range of $4 per million British thermal units, compared with highs of $13 as recently as 2005. The European spot price is around $10 per million B.T.U.\u2019s, and the Asian price around $15; contract prices, often linked to oil, may be higher.        ', u'\n                    And because it burns much cleaner than either coal or oil, it will very likely stay in favor because its use can help lower the greenhouse gas emissions that are blamed for causing ', u'.        ', u'\n                    To Mr. Brown\u2019s frustration, not everyone gets the message. That is one reason Shell\u2019s big L.N.G. bet is no sure thing.        ', u'\n                    The United States has wholeheartedly embraced gas. But Europe, mired in economic doldrums, has turned to coal, which is less expensive. This has driven down demand for gas in the region, which in recent decades had been one of the world\u2019s biggest markets for natural gas via pipelines and L.N.G.        ', u'\n                    Europe does not have \u201cthe right balance\u201d in terms of promoting gas, Mr. Brown said. About 75 percent of Shell\u2019s L.N.G. goes to Asia.        ', u'\n                    As much as anyone, Mr. Brown is responsible for making Shell a gas broker to the world. Before taking his current job, Mr. Brown presided over more than $20 billion in investments in gargantuan installations for turning the extensive gas deposits in Qatar\u2019s North Field into exports in the form of L.N.G. and liquid fuels like diesel.        ', u'\n                    To build on its lead, Shell agreed in February to buy the L.N.G. business of the Spanish company Repsol for about $6.7 billion. Some industry analysts considered the price too high. But according to Repsol, Shell had to outbid more than dozen competing offers.        ', u'\n                    The impact of Shell\u2019s L.N.G. investments on the company\u2019s financial performance will, of course, fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The first-quarter results on Thursday are expected to be hurt by a shutdown at a Nigerian L.N.G. plant caused by sabotage. And yet, Shell\u2019s quarter was probably helped by high L.N.G. prices in Japan, which continues to import large quantities of gas since the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in 2011.        ', u'\n                    Analysts\u2019 consensus forecast anticipates that Shell will report adjusted net profit of $6 billion for the quarter, an 8 percent gain over the preceding quarter, but an 18 percent decline from a year earlier, according to Peter Hutton of RBC Capital Markets in London.        ', u'\n                    On Tuesday, one of Shell\u2019s main rivals, BP, ', u' of $4.2 billion after adjusting for inventory changes and one-time items, which handily beat analysts\u2019 forecasts. BP, though, continues to emphasize its oil business.        ', u'\n                    Over the longer run, being a big player in L.N.G. is likely to help Shell outearn its peers, predicted Martijn Rats, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. The huge upfront investments of several billion dollars per gas liquefaction plant might seem prohibitive, Mr. Rats said, but those projects \u201cgenerate large amounts of operating cash flow over two or three decades.\u201d        ', u'\n                    While L.N.G. projects may not have as high potential returns as some oil fields, it is less risky to build giant gas installations because much of the output is sold in advance and the plants require relatively little capital expenditure once up and running. The steady cash from L.N.G., which at current prices produces profit margins of 10 percent to 15 percent, can be used to finance riskier activities.        ', u'\n                    One risk for Shell is that an anticipated export surge from North America leads to a plunge in the much higher prices for gas in Europe and Asia.

He helped their two salespeople, who were not used to this environment. These shows are a one-call close, whereas in retail it\u2019s not necessarily that way, not as fast pace, not as much pressure, where you have to close while you can or likely you\u2019re not going to close them.

', u'\n                    Shares of Deutsche Bank, the largest German lender, rose 5 percent in New York trading on Tuesday on expectations that the share sale will clear the way for higher dividend payments, even though an increase in the number of shares lowers each shareholder\u2019s cut of profits.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Jain and Stefan Krause, the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, portrayed the share issue as a turning point that would set the stage for the bank to focus less on its baggage from the financial crisis and more on growth and profit.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe could see where a capital raise would bring us to the point where the capital issue was off the table,\u201d Mr. Jain said.        ', u'\n                    European banks have as a rule taken longer to put the financial crisis behind them than American banks. The European lenders have had to deal with the burden of euro zone debt, but they also faced less pressure from regulators to confront their problems. Lately, though, there have been signs that some of the bigger banks are returning to health.        ', u'\n                    Investors had other good news to cheer from the bank this week. On Monday, the bank reported that net profit in the first quarter rose nearly 18 percent, to 1.66 billion euros, from 1.41 billion euros in the period a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    Though revenue rose a modest 2 percent, to 9.4 billion euros, the bank was able to cut costs. Mr. Krause said on the conference call that the bank expected to save about a billion euros over the full year.        ', u'\n                    Some analysts were still cautious about the bank\u2019s long-term prospects. The bank faces uncertainty over the European economy, which is stuck in recession. It also continues to address an array of legal proceedings that could be costly to resolve.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWhilst we still see risks from litigation, regulation and the macro environment, the strengthened capital position should put the group in a better position to deal with these challenges going forward,\u201d analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients. Credit Suisse upgraded Deutsche Bank shares to neutral, from underperform.        ', u'\n                    Deutsche Bank also said it would raise an additional 2 billion euros later in the year in the form of so-called hybrid equity, a form of debt that converts to shares in time of crisis and can thus be counted toward capital. The bank is waiting for German regulators to clarify rules for such instruments before it issues them.

', u'\n                    After years of painful job cuts and moves to make portfolios less risky, several large European institutions reported strong first-quarter results in recent days, helped by cost-cutting and better performance of major units.        ', u'\n                    On Tuesday, the Swiss bank ', u' and the ', u' of Britain surprised investors by reporting better than expected earnings for the first quarter, sending shares of both banks up.        ', u'\n                    The British banks ', u' and ', u', along with the French bank ', u', are among those still scheduled to report first-quarter figures in the coming days. But so far, the first-quarter results paint a somewhat encouraging picture of banks that have managed to limit losses from bad loans linked to the credit crisis, while reducing costs and returning to their core banking operations: credit and mortgages for some and wealth management for others.        ', u'\n                    UBS, for instance, reported on Tuesday a first-quarter profit of 988 million Swiss francs ($1 billion). Those results were down slightly from 1 billion francs in the period a year earlier, but far exceeded the 412 million francs predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Shares of UBS soared 5.67 percent in trading in Zurich on Tuesday.        ', u'\n                    Sergio P. Ermotti, the chief executive, cautioned that it was \u201ctoo early to declare victory,\u201d but said the earnings showed the company\u2019s \u201cbusiness model works in practice.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some investors note that the continuing difficulties in the euro zone and weak demand for loans mean that many European banks remain in trouble despite relatively good earnings in the first quarter.

', u'\n                    Still, European banks are moving actively to address their problems, including by slashing costs in the face of changing regulations and a sluggish European economy. ', u' reported on Monday after the markets closed that its first-quarter profit rose as cost-cutting offset a decline in revenue from investment banking. Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock also rose 4.7 percent in Frankfurt on Tuesday on the news that it would issue new shares to bolster its capital reserves.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThere are still some headwinds, but banks are pretty much there when it comes to reaching the right level of capital and that is helpful,\u201d said Cormac Leech, an analyst at Liberum Capital.        ', u'\n                    UBS has been eliminating 10,000 jobs, reducing bonus payments, scaling back its investment banking trading business and focusing more on its successful wealth management operation. Those steps helped the bank\u2019s first-quarter results.        ', u'\n                    UBS, its Swiss rival ', u', and ', u' of Britain all benefited from higher revenue at its investment banking operation. At Credit Suisse, pretax profit in its investment banking division rose 43 percent, the bank said last week. Barclays, which also reported earnings last Wednesday, said pretax profit for its investment bank rose 11 percent in the quarter.

Those results were a sharp turnaround from the \xa35 million loss Lloyds posted in the first quarter of 2012.        ', u'\n                    Analysts say European banks are also starting to recover from the fallout from numerous financial scandals that have hurt their reputations.        ', u'\n                    UBS, for example, has sought to rebuild trust among clients after it uncovered a $2.3 billion trading loss in 2011 connected with the activities of a former trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, who has since been sentenced to seven years in jail. In December, UBS said it would pay $1.5 billion in fines to settle a case related to the manipulation of the ', u', or Libor.

And it comes a day after Sprint won permission from SoftBank to begin limited talks with the latest suitor to determine whether the new proposal was likely to become a superior offer.        ', u'\n                    Dish has argued that its cash-and-stock bid for all of Sprint, valued at $7 a share, would create a new wireless titan whose phone, data and video services would rival those from ', u' Wireless and AT&T.        ', u'\n                    For now, Mr. Son insists that his earlier proposal, a two-step process that would leave 30 percent of Sprint publicly traded, is straightforward and can be completed by mid-July. The first part of the process, in which SoftBank invested $3.1 billion in the American company to keep it afloat, has already been completed.        ', u'\n                    \u201cCharlie\u2019s proposal does not provide any new cash into the company, and it provides heavy burden of debt,\u201d Mr. Son said in a telephone interview. \u201cI believe our deal will go through.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Son said he was not surprised by the arrival of Mr. Ergen, who has publicly amassed a cash hoard that many assumed would finance some sort of acquisition. Though Dish had already made a play for ', u', he said he guessed that the satellite TV company had even bigger ambitions.        ', u'\n                    \u201cMy guess was right,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    He repeatedly attacked Dish\u2019s bid as unworkable and his rival\u2019s numbers as misleading. By his own reckoning, factoring in both cost savings and potential costs like delays, SoftBank\u2019s offer was worth $7.65 a share, while Dish\u2019s was valued at $6.31. People close to Dish dispute that calculation, arguing that it includes a number of questionable assumptions.        ', u'\n                    Chief among Mr. Son\u2019s criticisms was the amount of debt that the competing offer would pile on to Sprint, which he estimated at $50 billion. In a long presentation to SoftBank\u2019s shareholders, Mr. Son argued that his proposal would increase Sprint\u2019s debt by three times, while Dish\u2019s would do so by nearly six times. \u201cIt would be prohibitively high debt,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    While Dish has trumpeted the amount of wireless spectrum the combined company would control, Mr. Son argued that the holdings would be excessive and expensive to maintain. And it would still require spending what he estimated was $6 billion to upgrade Sprint\u2019s network, while facing pressure to make use of its own spectrum holdings within the next four years.        ', u'\n                    And Mr. Son contended that Mr. Ergen, a wily deal maker whose net worth Forbes estimates is more than $10 billion, is an amateur when it comes to the mobile industry. By contrast, he pointed repeatedly to SoftBank\u2019s rise over the last seven years to become one of Japan\u2019s three biggest wireless companies.        ', u'\n                    For its part, Dish said in a statement: \u201cWe remain confident that the Sprint board will share our view that the Dish proposal is superior by offering Sprint shareholders greater value with a higher price and more cash, while also creating the opportunity to participate meaningfully in a combined, and competitively unique, Dish/Sprint.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Much of SoftBank\u2019s hopes are tied to Sprint\u2019s bid to buy the remainder of Clearwire, an offer that has drawn significant shareholder opposition.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Son dismissed concerns about the proposal\u2019s fate, saying that Sprint has not signaled any desire or need to raise its current offer of $2.97 a share. The company can\u2019t raise its bid without the blessing of its benefactor, SoftBank.        ', u'\n                    In the worst case, Sprint will raise its ownership in Clearwire to about 65 percent from 50 percent through agreements to buy out partners in the company, including ', u' and Brighthouse.        ', u'\n                    Speaking of dissident investors who think Sprint\u2019s offer is too low, Mr. Son said, \u201cThey can stay as shareholders for however long they want. We are happy with just 65 percent.\u201d        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

In a record-size bond deal, the company raised $17 billion, paying interest rates that hovered near the low-cost debt of the United States Treasury.        ', u'\n                    Apple\u2019s return to the debt markets raises a riddle: Why would a company with so much cash even bother to issue debt?        ', u'\n                    The answer has a lot to do with the frenzied state of the bond markets. Companies are issuing hundreds of billions of dollars in debt to exploit historically low interest rates. They are also feeding strong investor demand for high-quality corporate bonds as an alternative to money market funds and ', u', which are paying virtually nothing.        ', u'\n                    Apple\u2019s maneuver, however, also reflects the unusual challenges of a fabulously successful company with a sinking stock price. Apple is plagued by concerns that its growth may be slowing, and its shares have plummeted from a high last fall of more than $700 to under $400 last month.        ', u'\n                    In an effort to assuage a growing chorus of frustrated investors, the company is issuing bonds to help finance a $100 billion payout to shareholders. Apple said last week that it planned to distribute that amount by the end of 2015 in the form of paying increased dividends and buying back its stock. Since that announcement, Apple shares have risen 10 percent, closing at $442.78 on Tuesday        ', u'\n                    Taking on debt can actually magnify the returns for shareholders and improve stock performance, financial specialists say. It can reduce the overall cost of the capital that a company invests in its business. In addition, after a stock buyback, there are fewer shares, which can increase their value.        ', u'\n                    Yet even as shareholders and analysts welcome the financial tactics, they emphasize that the maker of iPhones, iPads and Macs must continue to innovate and fend off increasing competition. After all, today\u2019s Apple could be tomorrow\u2019s Palm.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThis is a substantial return of cash and it\u2019s the right thing to do on many levels,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cBut, ultimately, the company has to execute. This is no substitute for that.\u201d        ', u'\n                    By raising cheap debt for the shareholder payout, Apple also avoids a potentially big tax hit. About two-thirds of Apple\u2019s cash \u2014 about $102 billion \u2014 sits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions. If it returned some of that cash to the United States to reward its investors, it could have significant tax consequences for the company. In some ways, the bond issue is a response to that tax situation.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThey have been so successful with their tax planning that they\u2019ve created a new problem,\u201d said Martin A. Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a publisher of tax information. \u201cThey\u2019ve got so much money offshore.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The $17 billion debt sale by Apple is the largest corporate issuance on record, surpassing a $16.5 billion deal from the drug maker ', u' in 2009, according to Dealogic.        ', u'\n                    Apple joins a parade of large companies issuing debt with astonishingly low yields. Last week, ', u' sold bonds that mature in 10 years that yielded only 2.27 percent. In November, ', u' set the record for the lowest yield on a five-year bond, issuing the debt at 0.99 percent. In comparison, the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Tuesday was 1.67 percent, while the five-year note yielded 0.68 percent.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIf you look at these big companies like Apple and Microsoft doing these big, low-cost bond offerings, it\u2019s a way for them to raise money in an effort to create better returns for their shareholders,\u201d said Steven Miller, a credit analyst with ', u' Capital IQ. \u201cThe bond markets are practically begging these corporations to issue debt because of how cheap it is to raise money.\u201d        ', u'\n                    On Tuesday, Apple issued six different securities, with maturities ranging from a three-year note yielding 0.45 percent to a 30-year bond that yields 3.85 percent. The largest piece, a $5.5 billion issue, is a 10-year yielding 2.4 percent. While good for the company, longer-term bonds with yields this low can fall steeply in price if interest rates go up, hurting investors who hold them. Still, $3 billion of the Apple debt are notes whose interest rates are periodically reset.        ', u'\n                    Despite all the cash held by Apple, the credit-rating agencies have not awarded it their coveted AAA ratings, citing increased competition and a concern that its future product offerings could disappoint.

', u'\n                    Apple\u2019s less-than-perfect rating did not drive away investors on Tuesday. The offering generated investor demand of about $52 billion, according to ', u' and ', u', which led the sale of the issuance.        ', u'\n                    Desperate for returns in a yield-starved world, investors like insurance companies, pension funds and foreign governments have been snapping up corporate debt. Individual investors are also driving the demand: this year, through last Wednesday, a record $55 billion has flowed into mutual funds and ', u' that invest in corporate debt with high-quality ratings, according to the fund data provider Lipper.        ', u'\n                    ', u', Apple\u2019s co-founder and former chief executive, had long resisted calls to dispense big sums to investors. In 2010, when Apple\u2019s cash stood at $50 billion, he rejected pressure to make large distributions to shareholders. The company\u2019s cash balance continued to grow after Mr. Jobs\u2019s death in 2011, as it generated billions of dollars in earnings each quarter. Over the last 12 months, Apple operations have been generating about $150 million of cash a day.        ', u'\n                    A year ago, the new chief executive, ', u', announced a decision to start returning $45 billion to shareholders. But that did not satisfy everyone. David Einhorn, chief executive of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital and an Apple shareholder, pressed the company to do even more.        ', u'\n                    The excitement surrounding Apple\u2019s bond deal on Tuesday stood in stark contrast to the gloom that hung over the company when it last issued debt. In 1996, Apple faced a crisis, with shrinking sales of its niche computers and a weakening balance sheet that earned a junk credit rating. In the middle of the year, its shares reached a 10-year low.

But the dirty secret of venture capital is that the dream can be dashed as the venture capitalists make millions in a sale, leaving the founders with nothing.\n        ', u'\n                    \nA recent Delaware court case arising from the 2011 sale of Bloodhound Technologies illustrates how this happens.        ', u'\n                    Bloodhound was founded in the mid-1990s by Joseph A. Carsanaro to create fraud-monitoring software for health care claims. After several years of going it alone with a handful of colleagues, Mr. Carsanaro was able to raise Bloodhound\u2019s first venture capital round for $1.9 million in 1999, followed by a second $3.1 million round in 2000.        ', u'\n                    When the Internet bubble burst, the company underwent rocky times. It was then that the venture capitalists seized control. Mr. Carsanaro was pushed out as chief executive. By 2000, he was gone from the company, as were four other members of his founding team.        ', u'\n                    For the next decade, Bloodhound recovered and slowly grew, raising seven more rounds of financing. In April 2011, the company was sold for $82.5 million. It was a time for Mr. Carsanaro and his founding team to celebrate their millionaire status.        ', u'\n                    But venture capital investments are structured to ensure that the venture capitalists are paid before founders and employees. When venture capitalists invest, they typically demand preferred shares that accrue a yearly dividend of about 8 percent. The dividend goes unpaid until the company is sold. In a sale, the original amount and the interest all come due. It must be paid out before the common shares, which are typically held by the founders and other employees.        ', u'\n                    The requirement that the venture capitalist be paid first, and with interest, can sometimes hit founders and employees in a brutal manner, as Mr. Carsanaro and his colleagues discovered.        ', u'\n                    The venture capitalists took almost all of the sale price. Bloodhound also paid a $15 million bonus to its current management team. The five founders of Bloodhound were paid in total less than $36,000. One received all of $99.        ', u'\n                    There is not much information on payouts to founders and employees when a company backed by venture capital is sold. But from the few studies on the subject, it appears that the situation involving Bloodhound is all too common.        ', u'\n                    The ', u', by Profs. Brian J. Broughman and Jesse M. Fried, found that among a sample of venture capital deals, the common investors in roughly half the cases were entitled to nothing when the company was sold, even when the sale was for tens of millions. And in all but one instance, the majority of the sale proceeds went to the venture capitalists and other holders of preferred shares.        ', u'\n                    An ', u'by Shikhar Ghosh at the Harvard Business School found that three out of four companies backed by venture capital did not return the investment. Again, it is in these cases where the founders and employees typically are entitled to receive no payment.        ', u'\n                    For those entrepreneurs who think they will be the next ', u' and ride their company to riches, think again. A ', u' have found that most chief executives of companies that take venture capital investments end up being replaced.        ', u'\n                    These are the successful businesses. The rule of thumb among venture capitalists is that some 20 percent to 30 percent of companies fail, returning nothing to any investor, including the venture capitalists.        ', u'\n                    The Bloodhound case is a reminder that the founders of start-ups backed by venture capital often end up nothing like Mr. Zuckerberg. Instead, they find themselves thrown out and without significant profits even if their company is sold.        ', u'\n                    Venture capitalists will argue that this is the price to pay to get their money and services. Cash is king, and in order to survive, venture capitalists will demand a high price and return.        ', u'\n                    Yet entrepreneurs can protect themselves. Professors Broughman and Fried found in their study that founders who negotiated greater control rights ended up receiving on average $3.7 million more. They did this even when the common shareholders were not entitled to a dime. By negotiating board seats or other representation, the founders were able to ensure that a sale happened only with their approval and a demand for some payment in return.        ', u'\n                    In other words, the rights negotiated by entrepreneurs when taking venture capital money really matter. Many entrepreneurs are so excited to get money that they don\u2019t push for such rights or just don\u2019t know to ask. Yet those who negotiate to keep a say in their company have a future, while those who don\u2019t are more likely to be tossed aside. And it can be that this happens even in lucrative situations. Remember that Mr. Zuckerberg would have been forced by his venture capital investors to sell ', u' had he not kept control.        ', u'\n                    In the case of Bloodhound, its founders were pushed out of the company about eight years before the sale. During that time, they lacked control or ability to stop the venture capitalists from financing the company on the venture capitalists\u2019 terms. The only substantial communication the founders had after they left was when they found out that the company had been sold for a huge price and that they would receive almost nothing.        ', u'\n                    The five founders sued in Delaware court, claiming that Bloodhound\u2019s board and the venture capitalists had structured later rounds to favor themselves and dilute the payout of the founders. In a motion, the defendants countered that they acted fairly and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were untimely because they were brought years later.        ', u'\n                    J. Travis Laster, vice chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court, ', u'that the venture capitalist had favored themselves to the detriment of the founders could be a viable claim claim if the facts they stated were true.        ', u'\n                    If Bloodhound\u2019s founders are successful in their lawsuit, the case could change practices. It might require boards that take venture capital money to consider the founders and their interests before taking the next round. This could force boards to lean against diluting the payout of the founders and employees to avoid litigation.        ', u'\n                    Yet even if Bloodhound\u2019s founders prevail, other entrepreneurs will sometimes find that their company is sold with nothing going to them. The sad reality is that there are times when the price demanded by the venture capitalists for the company to survive means that the founders will lose. Let\u2019s face it, sometimes the company survives only because of that money and the skill and effort that the venture capitalists put in. This may have been the case in Bloodhound.        ', u'\n                    But the Bloodhound case publicizes this practice and will perhaps push boards to think harder before the founders are discarded. This may foster caution among venture capitalists, but the only thing that will truly save entrepreneurs is negotiating harder in the beginning. They may otherwise find themselves like the Bloodhound founders, left with nothing.

', u'\n                    Social media experts say there are several reasons why Twitter users would want to acquire large volumes of Twitter followers. For some people, it simply feeds the ego. For people and brands, a large Twitter following or Facebook fan base helps increase their visibility. If followers are constantly clicking on links to a brand\u2019s landing page, it also lifts the brand\u2019s position in Google\u2019s search results.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s natural for brands to want to build their Twitter and Facebook accounts because they are constantly looking for ways to expand awareness of their products and services and expand opportunities to create consideration of their products compared to others,\u201d said Susan Etlinger, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. \u201cThe more content they publish, and more links people click on, the better their Google search results. \u201d        ', u'\n                    Ms. Etlinger added that there was corporate pressure to justify a company\u2019s investment in social media.

', u'\n                    \u201cMany brands struggle to measure the top line value of social media,\u201d Ms. Etlinger said. \u201cSo there is a thirst to show momentum in different ways, one of which is to show that the brand has a bigger audience today than it did yesterday.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some major brands have expressed skepticism about the impact of social media fans and followers. Last month, Coca-Cola, whose flagship brand has over 700,000 Twitter followers and more than 60 million Facebook fans \u2014 more than any other brand on Facebook \u2014 said a corporate study found that online buzz had no quantifiable impact on short-term sales.        ', u'\n                    Social media fans and followers tend to be volatile, brand experts say. They may start following a brand for a specific contest or sweepstakes, then drop off when the campaign ends. But Mr. Stroppa and Mr. De Micheli said the follower changes they charted were drastic enough to warrant suspicion that they were purchased.        ', u'\n                    For example, Mr. Polis, a Democrat from Colorado with 22,140 Twitter followers on his personal @jaredpolis Twitter account, gained, on average, 15 new followers a day for two years. Then, last July, he added 19,705 new Twitter followers. A few months later, he lost 13,332 Twitter followers in one day.        ', u'\n                    A representative for Mr. Polis denied he had purchased fake followers and said one explanation for the sudden gains and subsequent losses was a \u201cfollow-back\u201d campaign. Last July, Mr. Polis said he followed a large number of new people from his personal account and asked them to follow him back. In March, he said he stopped following those accounts because he was becoming frustrated by the lack of relevant content in his Twitter feed. He now follows only 2,200 people. He surmised that a large number of followers may have stopped following him, too.        ', u'\n                    But Mr. De Micheli said that reasoning does not justify the sudden 19,705 jump in Mr. Polis\u2019s followers in one day. Twitter\u2019s own policy prevents users from following over 1,000 new people a day: \u201cEvery Twitter account is technically unable to follow more than 1,000 users per day,\u201d Twitter says on ', u'. \u201cPlease note that this is just a technical limit to prevent egregious abuse from spam accounts.\u201d        ', u'\n                    As for the sudden drop, Mr. De Micheli said it would be extremely rare for 13,332 followers to stop following the congressman on the same day. To have them stop following his account, Mr. Polis would have had to block 13,332 people manually, since the only way to stop an account from following you is to manually block it.

', u'\n                    Since the 2008 financial crisis, banks have been under intense pressure from regulators to raise capital so they are better able to absorb shocks. Deutsche Bank has faced criticism for having too little capital compared with other banks its size.        ', u'\n                    The bank had been reluctant to issue new shares, which dilutes the value of existing equity, and instead sought to raise the ratio of capital to money at risk by selling assets or other measures. The bank did not immediately explain its change of course, but it is becoming increasingly clear that banks throughout Europe have little choice but to take steps designed to prevent future financial crises. Shareholders of Commerzbank, Germany\u2019s second-largest bank, backed plans earlier this month to issue new shares.

', u'\n                    Banks also face a deadline to meet new global standards known as Basel III, which began taking effect this year. Deutsche Bank said the share sale and other measures would raise the ratio of capital to assets, as defined by the new rules, to 9.5 percent from 8.8 percent at the end of the quarter. That is comfortably above capital requirements that are being phased in through the beginning of 2019.        ', u'\n                    Deutsche Bank executives had earlier grumbled about the new rules, saying they were unnecessarily restrictive.

The sale will increase the number of existing shares by about 10 percent and could reduce the size of the dividend that shareholders would otherwise receive. Deutsche Bank said it would sell the shares privately to institutional investors and would not sell them publicly.

A similar fake report on a company stock could easily cost investors billions in a matter of seconds.

', u'\n                    Until now, information that has the potential to affect a company\u2019s stock price had for the most part been relegated to the bureaucratic sounding form 8-K, the S.E.C.\u2019s document of choice.

The new rules update the S.E.C.\u2019s Regulation Fair Disclosure, which requires companies to publish material information to all investors at the same time.        ', u'\n                    A spokesman for the agency, John Nester, argued that the new guidance on social media should not be too confusing, given how quickly companies adopted a 2008 rule that allowed the use of corporate Web sites in addition to S.E.C. filings.        ', u'\n                    \u201cCompanies were able to figure out how to use our guidance to disclose information on their Web sites, so there\u2019s no reason they shouldn\u2019t be able to do the same with social media,\u201d he said in a statement.

But the aim is to curb the government\u2019s involvement in mortgages.        ', u'\n                    As that happens, policy makers are hoping a major part of the mortgage market will come back. Specifically, they need the return of private bond investors, who once bought trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of mortgage-backed bonds with no government backing.        ', u'\n                    Other than some small bond deals, that market remains dormant. A major reason is that the banks that sell the mortgage-backed bonds are waiting for regulators to complete rules aimed at strengthening this market.        ', u'\n                    This is where down payments could play a crucial role. The proposed rules require banks to hold a slice of the mortgage-backed bonds they sell to investors. Banks do not like those types of restrictions.        ', u'\n                    But lenders would not have to keep a piece of the bonds if the underlying loans included features that made them less likely to default. These exempt loans would be called qualified residential mortgages. Regulators effectively proposed that these loans should have a 20 percent down payment.        ', u'\n                    The proposal prompted widespread objections from consumer advocates, bankers and home builders, who said the plan could shut many borrowers out of the housing market. Banks, they argued, are likely to focus heavily on making qualified residential mortgages. And if those mortgages require high down payments, lenders will be hesitant to make loans with little money down.        ', u'\n                    Consumer advocates make a nuanced case. They do not deny that down payments reduce the risk of default. But they say defaults can be reduced almost as much by applying other rules that curb lending to certain types of borrowers.        ', u'\n                    Consider another set of mortgage rules, already put in place this year. These rules emphasize the affordability of the loan. Under them, a borrower\u2019s overall monthly debt payments cannot exceed 43 percent of personal income.        ', u'\n                    In his study, Professor Quercia of the University of North Carolina found that loans that complied with those rules defaulted at a relatively low rate during the housing bust. About 5.8 percent of them went bad, irrespective of how much the borrower put down.        ', u'\n                    He then calculated the losses on loans to borrowers in the same group who had down payments of at least 20 percent. The default rate on that smaller group was lower, at 3.9 percent.        ', u'\n                    But that lower rate came at a cost. More than half of the borrowers in his study group had to be excluded from the second calculation, because they didn\u2019t have down payments of 20 percent or more. This shows how restrictive a down payment rule could be, said Professor Quercia.        ', u'\n                    Some real estate analysts are skeptical of this approach. They assert that the new mortgage rules, which do not insist on down payments, may be relatively ineffective at preventing high levels of defaults.        ', u'\n                    The debt-payments-to-income ratio is not a strong predictor of whether a loan will default, said Thomas A. Lawler, a former chief economist of ', u' who founded Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, a research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s not even in the top three,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Also, Mr. Lawler and others who favor higher down payments argue that Professor Quercia\u2019s analysis underestimates the psychological and practical importance of the down payment. Borrowers who saved up for down payments may have budgeting skills that later help them make their payments, they argue, and borrowers with equity in their homes are less likely to walk away altogether, rather than try to find a solution.        ', u'\n                    Supporters of a down payment requirement also make a broader argument. They point out that the financial sector overhaul was not just meant to protect borrowers. It was also intended to make banks and financial markets more resilient to shocks like housing busts. In other words, the legislation always envisioned a trade-off between homeownership and the stability of the financial system.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe key is what is the right balance between some risk and access,\u201d Professor Quercia said. \u201cJust looking at the risks is one-sided.\u201d        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

But instead of taking aim at storefront payday lenders, the banking authorities are focusing on the small operations\u2019 big bank rivals, like ', u' and U.S. Bank, according to several people briefed on the matter.

', u'\n                    The regulators are expected to impose more stringent requirements on the loans. Before making a loan, for example, banks will have to assess a consumer\u2019s ability to repay the money.        ', u'\n                    Banking authorities are also expected to institute a mandatory cooling-off period of 30 days between loans \u2014 a reform intended to halt what consumer advocates call a debt spiral of borrowers taking out fresh loans to cover their outstanding debt. As part of that, banks will not be able to extend a new loan until a borrower has paid off any previous ones.        ', u'\n                    Another requirement, the people said, will address marketing. Because the advances are not typically described as loans, the interest rates are largely opaque to borrowers. Wells Fargo, for example, charges $1.50 for every $20 borrowed. While the bank\u2019s Web site warns that the products are \u201cexpensive,\u201d there is no calculation of an interest rate. The banking regulators will require that banks disclose the interest rates, according to the people familiar with the guidance.        ', u'\n                    Some of the guidelines would hew closely to mortgage rules already required under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Under the law, lenders have to calculate a customer\u2019s ability to shoulder the principal and interest payments over the life of a mortgage.        ', u'\n                    The loans have proliferated since the financial crisis, according to consumer advocates \u2014 spurred in part by banks\u2019 aggressive search for fresh revenue after losing billions of dollars in income from regulations that restrict fees on debit and credit cards.        ', u'\n                    Banks deny that the loans are predatory and point out that lenders are simply catering to demand from consumers.

', u'\n                    For low-income consumers, the loans can result in a torrent of overdraft charges and fees. Borrowers who take out payday loans are roughly two times as likely to be hit with overdraft fees, according to a March report by the Center for Responsible Lending, an advocacy group.        ', u'\n                    The impact of the loans can be devastating for seniors, according to the report, because ', u' and disability payments deposited directly into checking accounts can be siphoned to satisfy fees incurred by the loan.        ', u'\n                    Annette Smith, 69, a retired caretaker in Rocklin, Calif., said she had been ensnared by the loans since she borrowed $500 more than five years ago against her Wells Fargo checking account.        ', u'\n                    She vows every month to never take out the high-cost credit again, she said, but each month a slew of bills undermines that promise. To cover the cost of the loan, the bank draws from Ms. Smith\u2019s Social Security income after her benefits of about $1,200 a month are deposited in her account.

It has the elements of a farce, and Dell\u2019s board has no one to blame but itself.\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe fizzled bidding for Dell is a result of the board\u2019s extreme reliance on a process known as a go-shop and how it ran the initial sale. If this episode does not change the way companies sell themselves, perhaps it should.        ', u'\n                    A go-shop is a device that companies started using about a decade ago. The go-shop typically provides that after a deal is announced, the target company shops like ', u', as a Delaware judge once put it, looking to see if another bidder is willing to compete.        ', u'\n                    Why would the first bidder allow this?        ', u'\n                    The answer lies in its origins. Go-shops were first used in private equity buyouts. The private equity firm would often team with management to make a bid, demanding exclusive negotiations. Boards would agree to this exclusivity but in exchange demand a period of time when alternative bids could be solicited. This way they could be assured that the company was being sold for the highest possible price.        ', u'\n                    Yet there is also plenty of skepticism about this process. The conventional wisdom is that go-shops are a hollow ritual. The feel-good perception that the company is being actively shopped covers up the fact that the initial bidder has a perhaps unbeatable head start. Once a deal is announced, others don\u2019t have time to catch up, nor do they want to get in a bidding war. A go-shop becomes just a cover-up for a pre-chosen deal.        ', u'\n                    There is truth to this. At least one study has found that go-shops don\u2019t generally attract higher-valued bids when management and private equity firms are involved. This makes sense. After all, if the original bidding group has management locked up, how is a subsequent bidder going to run the company?        ', u'\n                    Despite such concerns, the Dell board used both exclusivity and a go-shop in structuring the sale process, although it did add some frills to try to protect shareholders further.        ', u'\n                    Instead of running an open auction contest at the very beginning, the Dell board negotiated with the private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and ', u'. When K.K.R. dropped out, the board asked TPG to join the process.        ', u'\n                    But the board focused on only two bidders at a time and didn\u2019t reach out to others. Instead, when Blackstone called about a deal in January, it was left to bid only in the go-shop after it was announced that ', u' and Silver Lake were offering $13.65 a share to take Dell private.        ', u'\n                    It is curious that the Dell board adopted the go-shop process so wholeheartedly. Even in the best of circumstances, they are seldom successful. Since 2004 there have been 196 transactions with go-shops in them, according to the research provider FactSet MergerMetrics. In only 6.6 percent of these did another bidder compete during the go-shop period. More than 93 percent of deals with go-shops do not attract competing bids.        ', u'\n                    You can slot Dell into the overwhelming majority. The Dell board hired Evercore to run the go-shop, and the investment bank contacted 71 parties. Now Dell appears left with only ', u'.        ', u'\n                    It might have turned out differently, if the board had pulled Blackstone fully into the sale process before the announcement of an agreement to sell the company to Silver Lake and Mr. Dell. By failing to include Blackstone \u2014 with its growing technology practice that includes a former executive of Dell \u2014 from the get-go, it allowed the go-shop process to unfold in the harsh glare of the media.        ', u'\n                    And when your business is something like a melting ice cube, time matters. A recent International Data Corporation report showed the PC business in a free fall, with United States shipments down 12.7 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous year, and Dell falling behind its competitors. The deterioration in the business was one of the reasons Blackstone decided not to bid.        ', u'\n                    Hindsight is 20-20, of course. Still, Dell\u2019s board should have known that how it ran the sale would come under harsh scrutiny. Dell\u2019s biggest shareholder outside of Mr. Dell, Southeastern Asset Management, had told the Dell board before the proposed buyout was announced that it would not support a transaction where it could not roll over its shares and that was not in the range of $14 to $15 a share, according to a securities filing. That Southeastern is now heavily protesting this deal is no surprise.        ', u'\n                    People close to Dell vigorously defend the sale process, calling the go-shop a \u201csuccess\u201d since it brought Blackstone even this close to bidding.        ', u'\n                    But Dell\u2019s use of the go-shop now leaves its shareholders with a hollow choice. Silver Lake and Mr. Dell will most likely wait it out, possibly raising their offer a quarter or two at the last minute to win over shareholder holdouts. They certainly have no incentive to do anything before then or to do much more, if even that. And then shareholders will be forced to vote between this deal and taking the risk with a still publicly traded company that Blackstone has now so publicly spurned. It\u2019s really not much of a choice.

The tax treatment was widely known as the Amazon loophole, until Amazon dropped its opposition of the tax. (More on why Amazon did that in a moment.)        ', u'\n                    In Amazon\u2019s place has emerged its smaller rival, eBay, which has taken up the cause with a major campaign against the tax just as the issue is moving through Washington for the first time in earnest. On Monday, the bill cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, setting it up for a vote this week, and President Obama said he supported it.        ', u'\n                    Over the weekend, John Donahoe, eBay\u2019s chief executive, sent out an audacious e-mail to tens of millions of eBay merchants, pleading with them to write their representatives in Congress to block the legislation.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThis legislation treats you and big multibillion-dollar online retailers \u2014 such as Amazon \u2014 exactly the same,\u201d wrote Mr. Donahoe. \u201cIt may harm your ability to grow and costs jobs, including yours.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Talk about being heavy-handed.        ', u'\n                    Most of eBay\u2019s sellers have less than $1 million in out-of-state revenue and, under the terms of the proposal, the Marketplace Fairness Act, would be exempt from collecting the tax anyway.        ', u'\n                    It isn\u2019t until the end of Mr. Donahoe\u2019s letter that he argues for a compromise. If there is action, he wrote, the bill should be changed so that a small business is defined as making less than $10 million in out-of-state sales or having fewer than 50 employees. \u201cTo put that in perspective, Amazon does more than $10 million of sales every 90 minutes.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Donahoe, who deserves credit for turning around eBay in recent years, isn\u2019t trying to protect the mom-and-pop store or the struggling artist, he\u2019s trying to keep substantial businesses with real revenue from paying taxes.        ', u'\n                    When I asked an eBay spokeswoman to quantify how many eBay sellers would be affected by the legislation if it were not raised to the $10 million cap, she said she did not have a number. (Considering the amount of money and energy eBay is spending on its lobbying effort, you\u2019d think it would be able to quantify the cost.)        ', u'\n                    Part of eBay\u2019s argument is that it is too complicated and expensive for small merchants to collect the tax. \u201cAre you prepared to collect sales taxes in the more than 9,600 tax jurisdictions across the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Donahoe asked.        ', u'\n                    What Mr. Donahoe did not mention is that Amazon will already collect this tax for merchants if they ask, and eBay will help provide them with third-party technology services that will help them do this, too. There are a number of companies that will manage and streamline the process, like Avalara or TaxCloud. And you have to believe that if the bill gets passed, there will be a cottage industry of companies that will offer services to collect the tax, including eBay, which has made a reputation trying to streamline the selling process for merchants. In fairness, eBay also argues that a cost of complying with enforcement will be a nightmare. Think about the prospect of an out-of-state tax audit.        ', u'\n                    Before we continue, a little history: the reason the online merchants don\u2019t have to collect sales tax is a function of the Supreme Court ruling in 1992 in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota. In that case, Quill, a mail-order office equipment retailer, was sued over what North Dakota said was taxes due because Quill shipped products to the state. The court ruled that merchants did not have to collect taxes in a state unless they had a physical presence in the state. This covered mail-order businesses and, yes, the then-nascent business of Internet retailing. (Amazon didn\u2019t even exist then.)        ', u'\n                    A note to readers, and to self: If you live in a state with a sales tax, you are supposed to submit uncollected taxes on Internet purchases at the end of the year, even if the merchant doesn\u2019t seek it at the time of the sale. Of course, nobody does that.        ', u'\n                    At a time when states are desperate for revenue, you can see the allure of taxing online merchants. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, $23 billion is lost annually from out-of-state sales, a considerable portion from online transactions.        ', u'\n                    There\u2019s an argument to made, which eBay does, that the sales tax is regressive for businesses \u2014 and it is. The tax does not discriminate between a large, national retailer and a mom-and-pop. The tax is flat. And big business already has special tax advantages: states often offer big companies tax incentives to build stores and distribution systems, benefits that are not offered to small businesses.        ', u'\n                    But on the flip side, there is an argument that the current state of sales taxes online is regressive for consumers. Poorer people are less likely to be able to benefit from being able to shop online.        ', u'\n                    So what about Amazon? Why did it abandon the fight?        ', u'\n                    Not because it felt altruistic. It was a business decision. As Amazon has grown, it has become better positioned to handle the tax hit. And perhaps more important, it is moving to build physical warehouse and shipping centers in many states so that it can offer faster delivery services, in some cases within 24 hours.

In the last six months, through March 31, the number of cases is down 23 percent from the same period a year ago \u2014 a sharp contrast from recent years when the agency trumpeted its record-high numbers.        ', u'\n                    Some longtime S.E.C. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, also question whether their focus on insider trading cases distracts from investigations of broader significance. What\u2019s more, the officials say that the S.E.C. opened fewer investigations in the 2012 fiscal year than the previous year, presenting a potential obstacle to Mr. Ceresney, who will take the reins with George Canellos, an agency veteran.        ', u'\n                    The slowdown in cases could stem from any number of issues, including recent court rulings that curb the agency\u2019s power.        ', u'\n                    Longtime enforcement officials, however, attribute the decline to low morale at the Washington office.

It was only a week ago that ', u', a longtime prosecutor and defense lawyer, took over as chairwoman.        ', u'\n                    Some lawyers say that Mr. Ceresney, her first major hire, could breathe new life into the enforcement unit. They note that he was Ms. White\u2019s longtime lieutenant as both a corporate defense lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton and earlier in his career as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan.        ', u'\n                    \u201cHe has an incredible ability to master the facts,\u201d said Barry R. Goldsmith, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and the former chief litigation counsel at the S.E.C. who has worked on cases alongside Mr. Ceresney.        ', u'\n                    Ms. White announced on Monday that Mr. Ceresney would share the role with Mr. Canellos, who became the commission\u2019s interim enforcement chief this year when Mr. Khuzami left the agency. Mr. Canellos, who served as a federal prosecutor under Ms. White when she was United States attorney in Manhattan, is also a friend and former colleague of Mr. Ceresney.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI am excited to be charged with implementing Chairman White\u2019s mandate of bold and unrelenting enforcement and thrilled to be teaming again with George,\u201d Mr. Ceresney, 41, said in a statement.

', u'\n                    And while Mr. Canellos is well liked, people close to the agency say, some S.E.C. commissioners objected to his bid for more power. The commissioners were particularly concerned with Mr. Canellos\u2019s push to bolster the independence and authority of the enforcement unit, a move some investigators welcomed but might have isolated the commissioners from the investigative process.        ', u'\n                    He also irked some members of the S.E.C. trial team when he referred to them at an agency town hall meeting as \u201ccase killers,\u201d employing an obscenity as an adjective, according to people who attended the event. Mr. Canellos later apologized.        ', u'\n                    Despite the concerns, the joint leadership is likely to be temporary, people briefed on the matter said.

', u'\n                    And some S.E.C. officials argued that Mr. Ceresney, a newcomer to the agency, would benefit from Mr. Canellos\u2019s experience. He was instrumental, for example, in revamping the S.E.C.\u2019s policy for how companies use social media.

His appointment, which does not require Senate approval, could renew concerns about a revolving door that shuttles S.E.C. lawyers from the government to the private sector, and back again.        ', u'\n                    While at Debevoise, Mr. Ceresney represented a number of the nation\u2019s largest banks, including ', u' during an inquiry involving its foreclosure practices. Mr. Ceresney is expected to recuse himself from cases involving his former clients.        ', u'\n                    The S.E.C.\u2019s caseload presents another test for Mr. Ceresney. In addition to the dwindling number of actions, the S.E.C. is unlikely to catch any breaks from the courts. The Supreme Court recently rejected the agency\u2019s argument that it should have additional time before the statute of limitations in fraud cases expires.        ', u'\n                    The agency has run into resistance in the lower courts as well. Judge ', u' of the Federal District Court, for example, has said the agency\u2019s settlement with ', u' \u201cis neither fair, nor reasonable, nor adequate\u201d in part because it did not include any admission of wrongdoing.

', u'\n                    The delay involves a crucial but little-noticed part of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping financial sector overhaul that Congress passed in July 2010. One part of the legislation focused on the Fed. While the government used many different tools to shore up the financial system during the crisis, Congress was well aware that the Fed played a decisive role.        ', u'\n                    The central bank made huge loans to scores of domestic and foreign banks as markets seized up, dwarfing bailouts like the Troubled Asset Relief Program. But the identities of the borrowers were not disclosed at first, stoking concerns that the Fed had carried out a vast stealth bailout of Wall Street.        ', u'\n                    Against that backdrop, Dodd-Frank required the Fed to develop policies and procedures to safeguard taxpayers when making emergency loans \u201cas soon as is practicable.\u201d To some banking specialists, the delay suggests the Fed is stalling because it values the need to act freely in times of crisis.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe Fed might be thinking, \u2018We don\u2019t want to make a lot of rules that might hinder us from acting in an emergency situation that we can\u2019t anticipate,\u2019\xa0\u201d said Michael Bradfield, a former general counsel at the Fed.        ', u'\n                    When asked, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the Fed, did not say when the new rules would be completed.        ', u'\n                    Even without freshly written rules from the Fed, the Dodd-Frank legislation immediately introduced measures to make the central bank more accountable. For example, the Fed must now file regular and detailed reports to Congress if it undertakes any emergency lending.        ', u'\n                    Still, the overhaul went much further to set conditions on Fed loans during a crisis, and it is these measures that the central bank has yet to complete.        ', u'\n                    It has to have policies in place to prevent losses on emergency loans. For instance, the assets pledged to the Fed in return for the loans would have to be sufficient to absorb losses should the borrower default.        ', u'\n                    In an interesting twist, Congress also requested that when a bank participates in an emergency loan, its chief executive must certify that the bank is not insolvent at the time. The Fed would need to set out procedures for doing that.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI think the Fed should have reasonably broad discretion to deal with systemic issues,\u201d Mr. Bradfield said. \u201cBut then the question is, What\u2019s systemic and what\u2019s really needed, and what conditions ought to accompany that lending?\u201d        ', u'\n                    A person familiar with the Fed\u2019s thinking says any future emergency lending would still be bound by the demands of Dodd-Frank, even if the Fed has not issued rules by then. The central bank would still be obliged by the law to take careful steps to avoid losses, for instance.        ', u'\n                    Some banking analysts agree. \u201cIf something suddenly came up, they would make decisions based on Dodd-Frank, even if they had not previously published rules about how they would do this,\u201d said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the ', u'.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Elliott also says the Fed may be focusing on writing other important rules stemming from Dodd-Frank. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable that they have not given a priority instead to a rule about a hypothetical future crisis,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Still, unlike other rules, whose writing requires cooperation with several other agencies, the Fed can complete these itself after consulting with the ', u'. In addition, these emergency lending guidelines are likely to be far less complicated than regulations like the ', u', which aims to define the types of trading that banks are allowed to do.        ', u'\n                    Senior Fed officials have already been voicing concern about aspects of the financial system that were shored up by crisis loans. For example, Daniel K. Tarullo, the Fed governor who oversees regulation, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV last week that he was still concerned about \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks borrowing in credit markets \u201cthat are subject to runs and liquidity freezes.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Also last week, another Fed governor, Jeremy C. Stein, gave a speech that recognized one of the risks involved in the Fed\u2019s emergency lending programs. He spoke about moral hazard, the belief that government support can subsidize banks and make them less careful about the dangers inherent in their businesses.        ', u'\n                    One way to help address the moral hazard problem would be for the Fed to come out with the new rules on emergency lending. Depending on how strict the rules are, the banks might then realize that the Fed will not be a pushover in times of market stress.        ', u'\n                    But the Fed may find it hard to formulate rules that allow it to stem market panics without bailing out undeserving institutions.        ', u'\n                    \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put out rules that make you look vacuous and you don\u2019t want to put out rules that tie your hands,\u201d Mr. Bradfield said.        ', u'\n                    But whenever the rules appear, the Fed will face political scrutiny on such a contentious subject. \u201cNo rule about potential assistance from the Fed is going to be easy under the highly politicized conditions that exist today, with everything they do subject to criticism, especially if it helps financial institutions,\u201d Mr. Elliott said.

Business groups have railed against the law, criticizing it for chilling overseas business expansion and failing to provide companies with bright-line rules for how to conduct themselves overseas.

Specifically, they argue that there are not enough prosecutions of individual executives. Most foreign bribery cases, including the one involving Ralph Lauren, are brought only against the companies. Critics say that the corporate fines are insufficient to deter such acts and are simply added to the cost of doing business overseas.

The next largest company would be Heineken USA at 6 percent.        ', u'\n                    But even those large market shares understate the effect of the market power of the two largest companies, which tend to \u201cengage in significant levels of tacit coordination\u201d in pricing, the Justice Department said. Anheuser would usually raise prices in the fall, and shortly thereafter MillerCoors would follow suit, often with the same increase, the regulators said.        ', u'\n                    In certain geographic market areas, however, Modelo accounts for as much as 20 percent of sales, and that gives it a unique ability to enforce price competition on the larger companies in those markets.        ', u'\n                    From 2010 to 2012, the Justice Department said in its lawsuit, aggressive pricing by Modelo in California, Texas and New York City kept Anheuser from raising prices, forced it to lower prices or caused it to lose market share.

I received an inquiry from the mayor\u2019s chief of staff, and this was right after the London riots.

So what we offered to do was make this available to them pro bono.

The first thing I did was I sat down and just logged into the system myself and started making changes, based upon my knowledge of explosives. (In a prior life I ran an explosives detection company that I spun out of Georgia Tech.) There is a timeliness to this around gathering data and the best thing to do was to sit down and up the tempo of the system that we had running.

The analysis we conducted here was really around: were people around online talking about these much more destructive explosives? That\u2019s to figure out if there were any telltale signs of someone asking about these complex explosives becoming frustrated, deciding they would go for less destructive explosives, like TNT. It was also to determine whether there is any ongoing threat of people trying to use these more complex explosives.        ', u'\n                    Q.

Every time an explosive comes into contact with air it creates a unique vapor trail, a unique signature. So the signature for TNT is different than the signature for C4.

', u'\n                    Sure they do, but this is nothing new or unique to exchange-traded funds. Traditional mutual funds were invented to offer diversification.

Plus, you might be able to argue that the added competition from exchange-traded funds has driven down the cost of mutual funds. Remember, however, that there are also some very expensive E.T.F.\u2019s and some extremely cheap mutual funds.        ', u'\n                    3) E.T.F.\u2019s allow intraday trading.        ', u'\n                    Stop and think about that one for a minute. If you\u2019re investing for the long term, why do you care if you can trade your investment every hour, minute and second of the day? The benefit of intraday trading only matters if you\u2019re an active trader. And if you are, E.T.F.\u2019s will just let you cut your own fingers off that much faster.        ', u'\n                    4) E.T.F.\u2019s allow your adviser to place you in the right fund at the right time.        ', u'\n                    This is code for something that virtually no one can successfully do: time the market. Claiming that exchange-traded funds allow an adviser to add value by placing a client in the right fund at the right time is not only wrong, it\u2019s dangerous. Any adviser who claims to be able to time the market is an adviser you should run from. Advisers are valuable if they can help you avoid the costly behavioral mistakes we all tend to make, not because they claim to be able to outperform the market.        ', u'\n                    All the hype about E.T.F.\u2019s is just throwing more fuel on the behavioral fire (see intraday trading, market timing). Ultimately, E.T.F.\u2019s are just another tool that should be evaluated alongside all of the other tools available to help you reach your goals. To be clear, I\u2019m not saying that all E.T.F.\u2019s are bad. What I am saying is E.T.F.\u2019s alone won\u2019t solve our most vexing investing problem: our own behavior.

Its acquisitions include Tapco, which markets ammunition magazines for assault rifles, and Para USA, which produces 1911-style pistols.

A transaction could be completed as early as this summer, these people said.        ', u'\n                    It is unclear whether a buyer will materialize. The forced sale of a company is a poor position for a private equity firm to find itself in, let alone the sale of a controversial one.

Lawmakers have also urged large banks not to provide financing to gun companies, another pressure point that could pose challenges to any deal.

Another possible measure would force Mr. Feinberg to drop out of the bidding if another party offered a certain percentage above his bid.

The ballooning bottom lines could embolden the lawmakers and regulators who want to introduce additional measures to overhaul the banking system.        ', u'\n                    After the financial crisis, many officials involved in the regulatory revamp feared that tougher rules, like caps on bank assets, could destabilize the financial system and harm economic growth. It is a view that prominent bankers and lobbyists have also voiced.        ', u'\n                    Despite industry opposition to new rules, the buoyant bank profits could add to the ammunition that influential figures in Washington are using to advocate for more radical ideas to overhaul the banks.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI hope the regulators move forward with tougher regulations,\u201d said ', u', a former chairwoman of the ', u', a primary bank regulator, and now a senior adviser at the Pew Charitable Trusts. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t endanger the economic recovery.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Much has been done to strengthen banks since the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank legislation, which Congress passed in 2010, and international banking standards known as the Basel III rules are forcing banks to hold safer assets, curtail trading activities and set aside more capital to absorb potential losses.        ', u'\n                    Even so, there is bipartisan support to do more. Most recently, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator ', u', Republican of Louisiana, said that they planned to introduce a bill that would require banks to hold considerably more capital. If passed, such a requirement is likely to prompt the largest banks to shrink in size. While a draft of the legislation does not stipulate a maximum size for banks, it requires financial firms with more than $400 billion of assets to hold additional capital. Big banks like ', u' and ', u' well exceed that amount, as do Wall Street firms like ', u', but regional lenders would fall under that threshold.        ', u'\n                    The restlessness over the big banks extends beyond Congress.        ', u'\n                    Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who oversees regulation, floated an idea last year for limiting bank size. And Thomas M. Hoenig, vice chairman at the F.D.I.C., has been pushing the overhaul of large, complex banks as well as more rigorous capital standards.        ', u'\n                    The banking industry might be able to bear more regulations, given how it has fared under earlier measures. In some ways, the banks have thrived despite the added costs of all the new rules and demands since 2008.        ', u'\n                    Dick Bove, a bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, estimates that F.D.I.C.-insured banks will earn $39 billion in the first quarter of this year, which would be a record quarterly showing. \u201cNo one can argue that banks were hurt from a profit standpoint by regulation,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    The financial overhauls of the last four years don\u2019t appear to have held banks back from indulging in activities that facilitate economic growth. Helped by Wall Street financial firms, American companies have raised huge amounts in capital markets since the crisis. Last year, corporations issued $940 billion of bonds, a record amount, according to Dealogic, a data provider. This has happened even as investment banks scaled back their operations to get ready for regulations they vocally oppose, like the so-called ', u'.        ', u'\n                    The overhaul doesn\u2019t appear to have hurt the housing market, either. Large lenders like ', u' have profited well from the recent boom in mortgage refinancing. That activity has also helped consumers, through sharply lower borrowing rates for millions of homeowners.        ', u'\n                    Banks are also making significantly more loans to companies, which bolsters the economy and job growth in many parts of the country. There is even evidence that the overhaul may have helped the banks become better run. Citigroup, which was subject to much regulatory pressure, is more streamlined and reported strong first-quarter earnings this week.        ', u'\n                    Little of this might have been expected after hearing past warnings from bankers. In 2011, ', u', chief executive of ', u', said that the proposed rules to overhaul derivatives, a commonly used financial instrument, \u201cwould damage America.\u201d He also said that the Basel rules were \u201canti-American.\u201d Comment letters filed by lobbyists with regulators used sophisticated-looking models to show how rules could hold back the economy.        ', u'\n                    \u201cAs far as the banks are concerned, there is never a good time to raise capital or increase regulation,\u201d Ms. Bair said. \u201cWhen times are bad, they say it could hurt things, and when times are good, they say they don\u2019t need it.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some analysts, however, caution against reading too much into the banks\u2019 strong profits.        ', u'\n                    Though banks have been preparing for new rules for months, many of them have not been fully executed, which means the true costs of the measures will not be known until later.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Bove says that, while bank profits have hardly suffered from new regulation, their customers have. Lenders have simply passed on many of the costs, mostly in the form of new fees, he said. \u201cThe government aimed a Stinger missile at the banking industry and missed and hit the consumer instead,\u201d said Mr. Bove, who also notes that loans to small business are still weak.        ', u'\n                    In addition, bank profits may not be as strong as they look, say some analysts. Earnings appear less impressive when taking into account the new capital that banks have to hold. This can be seen when applying a metric called return on equity, which reflects the extra capital.        ', u'\n                    Financial companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had a 7.9 percent return on equity last year, according to data from S.& P. That\u2019s below the 10 percent return for utilities last year, also a regulated industry. And the banks\u2019 return is down from the 16 percent return that they achieved in 2006.        ', u'\n                    That is why some analysts argue that it would be a mistake to force banks to hold even more capital than they already will under Dodd-Frank and Basel III. They argue that it would depress returns on equity and therefore prompt banks to exit certain businesses, reducing credit in the economy. In a research note last week, a ', u' bank analyst estimated a Brown-Vitter bill could remove $3.8 trillion of credit from the United States banking system.        ', u'\n                    But considering that past dire forecasts haven\u2019t materialized, advocates for tougher rules may be tempted to press on.        ', u'\n                    Phillip L.

As a result, it will be hard for Morgan Stanley to keep up with competitors.

', u'\n                    Since the financial crisis, Bank of America\u2019s performance has been hurt by large mortgage-related losses, but in recent months investors have been betting that the bank would regain its footing. Its shares have risen nearly 35 percent in the last 12 months. Earlier this year, regulators approved the bank\u2019s plan to buy back stock, a clear sign they felt that the lender was on firmer ground.        ', u'\n                    In a statement, ', u', Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, said, \u201cOur strategy of connecting our customers to all we can do for them is working.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The question now is how the latest earnings will affect the recent optimism surrounding the bank, which lends to individuals and companies and has a large Wall Street presence through its ', u' unit.        ', u'\n                    Other large banks have reported earnings that exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates this quarter, so Bank of America\u2019s failure to do so may unnerve some investors. The debate will be over whether the bank fell short because of deeper issues that will be hard to resolve or because of items that will have less of a negative effect as time passes. On Wednesday, the bank\u2019s stock fell nearly 5 percent to close at $11.70.        ', u'\n                    Much uncertainty surrounds the cost of litigation over bad mortgages. Most of these troubled loans were made by ', u', which Bank of America acquired in 2008. Bank of America has settled several big mortgage lawsuits, including one on Wednesday for $500 million, which was led by the Iowa Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System. In the first quarter, Bank of America had litigation expenses of $881 million.        ', u'\n                    Some analysts wonder why the bank is still setting aside large amounts of money to cover mortgage lawsuits after reaching several settlements. \u201cMaybe they haven\u2019t been accruing enough for the outstanding litigation,\u201d said Todd L. Hagerman, an analyst with Sterne Agee & Leech.        ', u'\n                    In particular, analysts are focusing on a pending settlement with ', u'. The cost of this litigation, they say, could soar if the settlement does not gain court approval. A research note this year from Mike Mayo, an analyst with CLSA, suggested that the actual cost of the Bank of New York Mellon litigation could be as high as $30 billion, compared with the bank\u2019s estimated cost of $8.5 billion.        ', u'\n                    The bank defended its litigation reserves.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe believe we are appropriately reserved for the exposures we face, and we have provided investors with a range of possible loss estimates that could go beyond those reserves,\u201d said Jerome F. Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America.        ', u'\n                    Responding to the skepticism about the reserves against the Bank of New York litigation, he added, \u201cWe believe extrapolating selective rulings from other venues involving other litigants and facts and drawing conclusions about our settlements and other litigation matters does not portray a fair and accurate presentation of our litigation matters.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The first-quarter results also revealed a mixed performance in Bank of America\u2019s current mortgage business. Initially, the bank did not participate in the mortgage refinancing boom as strongly as rivals like ', u'. But in recent months it has jumped back in.        ', u'\n                    In the first quarter, Bank of America originated $23.9 billion of mortgages, well up from $15.2 billion a year earlier. But revenue from writing new mortgages actually fell to $815 million from $928 million in the period a year earlier. This shows that profit margins in the new mortgage business have fallen as Bank of America has increased its activity.        ', u'\n                    The quarter contained bright spots for shareholders. The bank said it made headway in cutting expenses, something investors are watching closely.        ', u'\n                    In addition, Bank of America set aside significantly less money for its reserve against bad loans, which helped earnings.        ', u'\n                    Its wealth management unit, which includes the Merrill Lynch brokerage house, had a strong quarter. Revenue in the unit rose to $4.4 billion a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    While Bank of America\u2019s earnings per share increased a lot when measured using generally accepted accounting principles, it declined on another measure that investors often look at. This nonstandard metric excludes arcane accounting charges. Without those charges in the first quarter of 2012, the bank made 31 cents a share.        ', u'\n                    This year\u2019s first quarter contained little effect from such charges, so the 20 cents a share the bank reported on Wednesday should be compared with the 31 cents a share from the period a year earlier. In effect, under this approach, Bank of America\u2019s earnings fell more than a third.

Supposedly, all of this will drive a self-sustaining economic recovery.        ', u'\n                    Instead, the Fed has kindled speculation. Investors are desperate for yield and are paying up for riskier assets. In areas like real estate, structured finance and equities, the markets are ahead of the fundamentals. It doesn\u2019t look to me like a bubble yet. But I would call it the Dysplasia Stage, abnormal growth that looks precancerous.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s not just an economic or financial issue, it\u2019s cultural and psychological.

One gauge, the price of stocks based on the past decade of earnings, is named after the Yale economist ', u'. Using that, stocks are too expensive by 65 percent. Alternatively, many investors look at something called the Q, devised by the economist James Tobin, which compares stock prices with corporate net worth. The nonfinancial companies are overpriced by 57 percent. The stock market is not at 1999 or 1929 levels, but it has reached other previous peaks of 1906, 1936 and 1968, according to Smithers & Company, a London-based research shop.

He expects earnings to fall.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s not just stocks. Investors are bidding up junk bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and bundles of corporate loans called collateralized loan obligations. Last month, investors ', u'for such loans than at any time in the last five years. They are ', u' made up of subprime ', u'.        ', u'\n                    And the housing market isn\u2019t just rising, but roaring back so fast you can feel the G-force coming off the reports. Home prices in Phoenix went up 23 percent over the last year, according to the latest Standard & Poor\u2019s Case-Shiller index. More than one in four homes in Phoenix was purchased by an investor who bought more than five homes, up from 16 percent a year earlier.

To a certain degree, yes. Many Americans have been able to refinance their homes. Those auto loans may be helping people get to and from work.        ', u'\n                    But the economic effects are modest for the size and scope of the effort. Investors glory in the asset inflation. The most pronounced effect of low mortgage rates has been to allow people with good credit and low debt to refinance multiple times over the last few years. Stock ownership is concentrated among the wealthy; junk bonds and collateralized loan obligations only more so.

', u'\n                    Judge Rakoff called the settlement \u201cchump change\u201d for Citigroup and suggested that the agreement was not in the public interest. The bank and the S.E.C. said the judge had overstepped his bounds in interfering with the decision of a government agency.        ', u'\n                    The S.E.C. has traditionally permitted defendants to settle regulatory actions by paying a fine while not admitting liability, arguing that the practice is efficient and less costly than taking deep-pocketed financial firms to court and risking losing the case.        ', u'\n                    Much of Judge Marrero\u2019s 34-page opinion centered on the \u201cneither admit nor deny wrongdoing\u201d language contained in the SAC settlement and many other settlements struck by the S.E.C. In recent months, federal judges across the country have followed Judge Rakoff\u2019s lead and suggested that the S.E.C. and other government agencies were letting defendants off lightly by not forcing them to acknowledge wrongdoing.        ', u'\n                    Judge Marrero indicated that the \u201cneither admit nor deny\u201d boilerplate had no place in a post-financial-crisis world.        ', u'\n                    \u201cPerhaps we live in a different era,\u201d Judge Marrero wrote. \u201cIn this age when the notion labeled \u2018too big to fail\u2019 (or jail, as the case may be) has gained currency throughout commercial markets, some cynics read the concept as code words meant as encouragement by an accommodating public \u2014 a free pass to evade or ignore the rules, a wink and a nod as cover for grand fraud, a license to deceive unsuspecting customers.\u201d        ', u'\n                    \u201cPerhaps, too, in these modern times,\u201d he added, \u201cnew financial, industrial and legal patterns have merged that call for enhanced regulatory and, as appropriate, judicial oversight to counter these sinister attitudes.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Despite his skepticism about the S.E.C.\u2019s settlement practices, Judge Marrero tentatively signed off on the commission\u2019s deal with SAC. The case related to the conduct of a former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma, who was charged in November with illegal trading in two pharmaceutical stocks and helping SAC make $276 million in illicit profits and avoid losses. Mr. Martoma has denied the charges.        ', u'\n                    Last month, Judge ', u' approved a separate S.E.C. insider trading case against SAC, signing off on a $14 million settlement that resolved accusations that the firm\u2019s Sigma Capital unit had illegally traded in shares of technology. As part of that agreement, SAC neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Judge Baer raised no issues with the deal.        ', u'\n                    SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., and owned by the investor Steven A. Cohen, has emerged as a focus of the government\u2019s multiyear investigation into insider trading at hedge funds. The two civil matters \u2014 the $602 million case and the $14 million one \u2014 are the only legal actions against SAC, but the government has brought criminal insider trading charges against several of its former employees, including four who have pleaded guilty.        ', u'\n                    Representatives of the S.E.C. and SAC declined to comment on the judge\u2019s ruling. Mr. Cohen has not been accused of any wrongdoing.        ', u'\n                    Judge Marrero laid out a court\u2019s balancing act in weighing the approval of settlements struck by government agencies that do not force a defendant to admit liability.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe court must avoid undue meddling and second-guessing, and must accord government agency law enforcement and financial determinations such as those now before it the proper level of deference they are due,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cAt the same time, the court cannot conceive that Congress intended the judiciary\u2019s function in passing upon these settlements as illusory, as a predetermined rubber stamp for any settlement put before it.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The judge\u2019s words seemed to suggest that he was grudgingly approving the SAC agreement. On page after page, Judge Marrero used strong language \u2014 and lengthy sentences \u2014 to convey his discomfort with the S.E.C.\u2019s policy. In one part of the opinion, he said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the practice; a paragraph later, he expressed \u201cmisgivings\u201d about it. At another point, he called the terms \u201cboth counterintuitive and incongruous\u201d and sharply criticized the government\u2019s settlement practices.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe damage the victims suffer cannot always be blamed on acts of God or the mischief of leprechauns,\u201d said Judge Marrero. \u201cThere cannot be proper closure when incidents causing extensive loss occur, if the individuals or entities responsible for the large scale wrongful consequences are not properly held accountable.\u201d        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.        ']), ([u'DEALBOOK; In Shareholder Fights, Activists Aim at Bigger Targets'], [u'\n                    The annual proxy season battle between shareholders and corporations appears to have reached a tipping point in favor of shareholders this year. And while some may hope that this will change public companies for the better, we may instead end up with something resembling trench warfare.\n        ', u'\n                    \nWhat is clear is that shareholder activism is reaching further into corporate America. The proxy advisory service Institutional Shareholder Services is projecting that there could be as many as 17 contests for the election of directors.        ', u'\n                    This is only a slight uptick from last year, but the difference is that the contests are much bigger this time around and include six at companies with a market value of more than $1 billion. Last year, the only billion-dollar company to have a contested election was the ', u', which successfully thwarted an effort by the activist investor ', u' to get directors on the board.        ', u'\n                    Already this year, two billion-dollar companies have held contested elections: TPG-Axon Capital Management\u2019s effort to remove the entire board at the oil and gas explorer SandRidge Energy, and the Ader Group\u2019s effort to elect three directors at ', u', a manufacturer of gambling machines. At SandRidge, a settlement with activist investors led to four nominees of the hedge fund being put on the board and an agreement for the departure of the chief executive. In the case of International Game, one independent director was elected.        ', u'\n                    These victories illustrate that activists win more often than not in board elections. So far this year, according to the data provider FactSet SharkRepellent, 66 percent of contests have been successful for the activists. This is up from 51 percent last year, though we are still early in the season.        ', u'\n                    Activists owe part of their success to I.S.S. and a rival, Glass, Lewis & Company. I.S.S. in particular is followed by many mutual funds and other institutional investors, and studies have found that it can sway up to 10 percent of the vote and much more in highly public elections. And it often recommends in favor of the dissidents. Last year, it recommended in favor of the dissidents in 52 percent of campaigns. So far this year, that number is up to 73 percent. This is not completely surprising because the companies that are targets for activists are typically poor performers or in need of change.        ', u'\n                    This year, the activists are leveraging this advantage to supersize their contests. Elliott Management is taking aim at the $23 billion ', u', an energy company that Elliott contends has underperformed the market by more than 460 percent over the last 17 years while paying its management and directors $540 million.        ', u'\n                    Hess has responded the way many other companies now do when faced with an activist: try to change. The company has replaced directors wholesale and disclosed that it is ', u' to dispose of assets and focus on exploration and production. Elliott is unimpressed and is pursuing its contest.        ', u'\n                    Not even big companies are immune to proxy activism. But as activists aim at bigger targets, they are adapting their strategies. A popular tactic in years past has been to argue for spinoffs of a company\u2019s low-growth businesses. Now, the goals can be much more varied. David Einhorn, for example, has sought to make an issue of Apple\u2019s enormous cash pile. Then there is the increasingly prominent opposition activism in mergers that we are seeing with Dell and its shareholder revolt, led by Southeastern Asset Management.        ', u'\n                    There are also campaigns to separate the job of chairman of the board from the chief executive, like the proposal at ', u'. In all, Alliance Advisors is predicting more than 600 proposals for ', u' this year, like separating the chairman and chief executive roles and changing corporate political spending.        ', u'\n                    Success is bringing new entrants. The California teachers\u2019 pension fund has joined forces with the investment firm Relational Investors to campaign for the breakup of the ', u' into steel and bearing businesses.        ', u'\n                    Former employees of star activists are forming their own funds. The heated battle to replace the board at Commonwealth REIT is being led by a former Icahn disciple, Keith Meister, and Corvex Management, while Mick McGuire of Marcato Capital Management, who recently won a seat on the board of the ', u', is from William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square. There is even a project affiliated with Harvard Law School to bring proposals to force boards to have annual instead of staggered elections.        ', u'\n                    The surge in shareholder activism is not all puppies and rainbows, however. There are questions about whether these changes push companies to focus on the short term or are too distracting from the real business of running these companies. And of course, there is always the question whether boards or shareholders are better situated to decide the future of the company.        ', u'\n                    Many companies are getting prepared for the activists and are ready to fight back.        ', u'\n                    They are doing so in two ways. First, companies are adopting provisions to fend off the activists. Long and convoluted notice periods are now commonplace, and many companies are adopting shareholders rights plans, or poison pills, with low thresholds, effectively limiting the number of shares an activist can acquire to 5 to 10 percent of a company.        ', u'\n                    And not surprisingly, companies are trying to regulate this type of activism out of business. The ', u' is preparing to announce rules for the regulation of proxy advisers, and corporate America is lobbying to try to diminish the influence of I.S.S. through these rules. Companies and their representatives are also trying to get regulators to increase the disclosure requirements for activists.        ', u'\n                    This may be only a start. In the 1980s, when corporate America was under attack from hostile raiders, companies pushed hard to get legislatures to adopt anti-takeover measures and to validate poison pills. They succeeded. As activism becomes more commonplace, expect the companies to push back harder by looking for a way to avoid these attacks.        ', u'\n                    In other words, don\u2019t expect corporate America to fold quietly. Instead, the battle is more likely to spread to regulators and legislators as companies take a proactive stance in anticipation of shareholder activism. But if anything, that activism is here to stay. It all means that the battle between shareholders and companies is likely to get only worse in coming years as the barbarians at the gate become ever more bolder and innovative.

With those guidelines, it is taking a page from Apple\u2019s playbook, by being much more restrictive about the glasses than it has been with other products, particularly its Android operating system for phones, and controlling the type of apps that developers build.

', u'\n                    Just as the iPhone ushered in a new wave of computing on mobile phones, Glass could be the beginning of wearable computing becoming mainstream.

', u'\n                    Since the financial crisis, Goldman has largely defied critics who predicted the death of its business model. Those calls were hardly surprising. Goldman and its competitors are operating with less borrowed money, which has drastically reduced profitability, and the billions that Goldman made packaging and selling securities from mortgages has all but disappeared. New regulations aimed at curbing the risk-taking that led to the financial crisis have further eaten into profits.        ', u'\n                    The company has also suffered a number of blows to its reputation, including accusations by the ', u' that it defrauded its clients.        ', u'\n                    Yet the resilience of Goldman was amply demonstrated on Tuesday, as the company reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.        ', u'\n                    Results were driven by strength in its investment banking business as well as its investing and lending operations. Goldman reported a first-quarter profit of $2.2 billion, up 5 percent from the same period a year ago.        ', u'\n                    The results also underscored the challenges \u2014 regulatory and otherwise \u2014 facing the bank.        ', u'\n                    Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura, said that while the company\u2019s earnings were good, roughly $2 billion in revenue came from investments that tended to fluctuate in value, which is troublesome to some investors. Shares of Goldman fell on Tuesday, closing down 1.6 percent, at $144.10.        ', u'\n                    \u201cOn a relative basis Goldman is doing well, but there is still a lot of uncertainly facing Goldman and its rivals,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Relative may be the operative word. Goldman has benefited in part from the misfortunes of others. While all banks are under pressure to cut employees and compensation, the competitive landscape is shrinking.        ', u'\n                    \u201cAll this should translate into more profits for the banks that survive,\u201d Mr. Schorr added.        ', u'\n                    After ', u' failed in 2008 and JPMorgan Chase bought ', u', Goldman picked up market share from these two companies.        ', u'\n                    Since the financial crisis, new regulations have made it more expensive for banks to stay in fixed income, and companies like ', u', ', u' and ', u' have shrunk their operations as a result. Goldman, which was less damaged by the financial crisis than some of its competitors, made a decision early on in the wake of the crisis not to pull out of fixed income, which now provides a diminished but still significant portion of Goldman\u2019s revenue.        ', u'\n                    Europe\u2019s debt crisis has meant that bonds have been replacing bank loans in corporate finance on the Continent, and Goldman has been a major player in this shift. The bank has also picked up market share in other businesses like trading and in creating securities like equity derivatives, an area that had previously been dominated by European banks.        ', u'\n                    Goldman has also expanded into debt underwriting, a corner of Wall Street normally dominated by rivals like ', u' and JPMorgan. In the first quarter, Goldman had revenue of $694 million in this area, a record.        ', u'\n                    Even as it has picked up market share, however, Goldman faces the same harsh markets and regulatory burdens as its rivals. The financial regulatory overhaul in the United States is forcing Goldman and others out of lucrative businesses like proprietary trading, where banks make directional bets on the market with their own money. And American banks will soon be operating under tougher capital requirements already being met by many European banks, something that could further crimp profits.        ', u'\n                    To offset slowing revenue growth, Goldman, like other banks, has been cutting costs and people.        ', u'\n                    There is one significant change in personnel the company hasn\u2019t made, however. Goldman has stuck by its chief executive, ', u', who was largely viewed as a liability during the financial crisis. Some shareholders say he has provided stable leadership at a time when top ranks are changing at other banks.        ', u'\n                    After seven years at the helm, Mr. Blankfein, 58, is now one of the longest-serving chief executives on Wall Street, raising questions about when he might retire.        ', u'\n                    His most likely successor is Mr. Cohn, the Goldman president, who as a former metals trader is cut from the same cloth as his longtime friend Mr. Blankfein, suggesting the company would not change gears should Mr. Cohn take over in the coming years.        ', u'\n                    But the core business unit that has produced many of Goldman\u2019s leaders and has helped define its culture \u2014 the powerful division that trades bonds, currencies and commodities \u2014 produced lower year-over-year results for the first three months of the year. Net revenue for the division fell 7 percent, to $3.2 billion, from the period a year earlier.

', u'\n                    The debate comes at a particularly perilous time, as economic officials from the United States and other countries gather for the annual spring meeting of the ', u' and ', u' in Washington, where many are expected to urge high-debt Europe to ease up on its commitment to austerity in the face of rising unemployment and new economic contractions.        ', u'\n                    The controversy stems from a ', u' by economists at the ', u', Amherst that claims to have found some basic errors in one of the most pathbreaking and influential economic studies to come out in the last few years.        ', u'\n                    That was a 2010 ', u' by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard, also authors of a best seller, \u201cThis Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.\u201d The economists, analyzing 3,700 separate economic observations, found little relationship between growth and debt for countries with debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios of 90 percent or less. But for countries with debt loads equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output, \u201cmedian growth rates fall by 1 percent, and average growth falls considerably more.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Many politicians interpreted the research as showing a direct relationship between debt and growth. If a country reached a debt burden of more than 90 percent of its annual economic output, the logic went, it would quickly fall into a debt trap that would leave it struggling to grow in the coming years. Prominent politicians \u2014 including Olli Rehn of the ', u' and Representative ', u', the chairman of the House Budget Committee \u2014 cited it as a reason to try to impose major budget cuts.        ', u'\n                    The Harvard economists\u2019 research was always more nuanced about the causal relationship between debt and growth than the popular view. Some economists expressed skepticism of the \u201cthreshold\u201d theory to begin with. And many others noted how hard it could be to draw straight lines between debt and economic growth, given the panoply of factors at work.        ', u'\n                    But now, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in trying to replicate the Reinhart-Rogoff results, are challenging the conclusions for a different reason. They say they found some simple miscalculations or data exclusions that sharply altered the ultimate results. According to their rerunning of the figures, \u201cthe average real G.D.P. growth rate for countries carrying a public debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not \u20130.1 percent,\u201d they write. In other words, heavy debts were not associated with the malaise that Professors Reinhart and Rogoff \u2014 and much of the world\u2019s economic elite \u2014 thought that they were.        ', u'\n                    The new paper, released this week, has set off a storm within the economics profession, with some commentators even arguing that it undermines the austerity policies that have proved so prevalent in the last few years.

', u'\n                    Other experts said that separate pieces of research had found similar results to the Harvard professors\u2019 paper, using alternative data sets and significantly strengthening the argument that higher-debt economies suffered from slower growth.

But they argued that the Amherst authors had also found lower growth rates when a country had debts equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output. \u201cIt is hard to see how one can interpret these tables and individual country results as showing that public debt overhang over 90 percent is clearly benign,\u201d they wrote.        ', u'\n                    The seemingly esoteric debate within the economics profession has collided this week with a broader challenge to excessive budget-cutting in countries around the world. The I.M.F. cautioned Washington against cutting its budget too fast, too soon, even as it saw the American economy strengthening.

Penney said in a statement that it had borrowed $850 million from a credit line that makes a total of $1.85 billion available to the company.        ', u'\n                    For all its woes, the retailer\u2019s operations have until recently produced reasonably robust cash flows. And at the start of February, the company had a little more than $900 million of cash in hand.        ', u'\n                    Therefore, the decision to tap its loan now, rather than wait until the company\u2019s cash use spikes later in the year, suggests that Penney\u2019s year has had a particularly bad start. Customers have not responded well to brash changes instituted by Ron Johnson, the previous chief executive. Sales have been slumping for months.        ', u'\n                    And another piece of news in Monday\u2019s statement could deepen the cash concerns. The company said that in addition to tapping its credit line, it was looking into other ways of raising money.        ', u'\n                    Though these may seem like desperate moves, there are good reasons to undertake these measures: Penney\u2019s executives are wisely taking pre-emptive steps to avert the sort of panic that has felled many a retailer.        ', u'\n                    When a department store faces financial problems, suppliers get nervous and demand to be paid for their goods much more quickly \u2014 or even up front.        ', u'\n                    This can reduce cash balances at the retailer, in turn prompting suppliers to demand even stiffer payment terms. Eventually the spiral can lead to bankruptcy. Witness what happened to Circuit City, which collapsed four and a half years ago.        ', u'\n                    It doesn\u2019t have to end like that, though. There are instances of retailers taking actions to buy time and quelling the nerves of suppliers in the process. One example is ', u', which last year avoided an aggressive squeeze by suppliers even though its operations were still faltering.        ', u'\n                    Fighting panic often has a psychological element, something Penney\u2019s board and major shareholders appear to grasp. A desire to pacify suppliers, often referred to in the industry as vendors, may also have been behind the departure of Mr. Johnson.        ', u'\n                    \u201cKeeping the vendors happy is key for the company at this point, and that seemed to be a driving factor in the C.E.O. decision,\u201d said James Goldstein, a senior credit analyst at CreditSights.

', u'\n                    Having drawn down part of the credit line, Penney has an extra $850 million in the bank, at least for now. If it raised an additional $1 billion from other sources, suppliers might breathe more easily, and the retailer might never need to spend any of the new money.        ', u'\n                    If the company does try other methods to raise new cash, much depends on how it goes about it. One way is just to sell new shares, which might hurt the already pulverized stock price. But an infusion of new equity could strengthen the balance sheet, since it wouldn\u2019t add to the company\u2019s debt levels.        ', u'\n                    However, selling a large amount of new stock may be tough, given the pain the stock decline has caused, says Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit.        ', u'\n                    \u201cLet\u2019s face it, two major investment firms have already held minority stakes for some time \u2014 Vornado and Pershing Square \u2014 and both have lived to regret it,\u201d Ms. Levenson said in an e-mail. \u201cDoes anybody have ', u'\u2019s number?\u201d ', u' is a public company that owns and manages commercial buildings. Pershing Square is a hedge fund run by William A. Ackman.        ', u'\n                    Penney could try to raise new cash by selling debt. In that case, it would be intriguing to see what it provides as collateral to the new creditors. On paper, banks already have the right to some assets, like inventory. One option would be to use some of the company\u2019s buildings as collateral. Analysts at ', u' estimate that the retailer\u2019s owned real estate is worth about $2.5 billion.

Ms. Sanyour, a television producer who lives in Des Moines, said she had devoted an entire paycheck this month to wiping out her debt on a Citigroup credit card.

Such a tepid appetite for loans underpinned Citigroup\u2019s results on Monday. While total loans inched up slightly in the first quarter to $539 billion, the bulk of the growth stemmed from demand among corporate clients beyond the United States. Consumer lending rose just 1 percent in the first quarter. In North America, revenue in the global banking unit stagnated, falling by 1 percent to $5.1 billion.

', u'\n                    Citigroup\u2019s quarterly earnings underscore broader challenges buffeting the United States banking industry. On Friday, ', u' and ', u' reported declines in revenue, slowed in part by mortgage machines that are beginning to sputter. The refinancing boom, fed by federal largess that drove down interest rates and spurred a flurry of refinancings, is showing signs of petering out.        ', u'\n                    Combined with Citi\u2019s earnings Monday, the results are propelling worries that banks are floundering to offset income sapped by a spate of new financial regulations and a lackluster economy. Sluggish loan demand is renewing those concerns. ', u', the influential chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, called loan growth \u201csoft\u201d for the quarter when the bank reported earnings on Friday.        ', u'\n                    Beyond the banking results, other indicators of economic health have proved dispiriting as well. Retail sales in the United States fell by 0.4 percent in March. Even though unemployment is falling, consumers remain unconvinced.        ', u'\n                    Part of the wariness among consumers, banking analysts say, arises from broad skepticism about the housing market. Even though housing prices have been rising recently, the improvements won\u2019t rouse consumers until they remain steadily high for a longer stretch, according to analysts. \u201cIf housing prices start to stall even a little bit, then we are going to see an even greater retreat from consumers,\u201d said J.

', u'\n                    Citigroup has pinned some of its hope for future profitability on its vast international footprint, but some regions produced lackluster returns. Revenue from consumer banking in Asia fell in the first quarter to $2 billion, down 1 percent from the same period a year earlier. The bank is struggling to navigate the shifting regulatory landscape in Asia. In South Korea, for example, national officials placed a cap on the interest rates of a range of consumer loans. Mr. Gerspach said that there were \u201cstill headwinds\u201d in the region.        ', u'\n                    Despite the challenges, Citigroup showed strengths in other parts of its business. A bright spot in the first quarter was the securities and banking group, which was bolstered by strong gains in investment banking, fixed income and equities.        ', u'\n                    Revenue in that unit surged 31 percent, to $6.98 billion, while net income was $2.3 billion, up 81 percent from the period a year earlier. For Citigroup, the unit has been a consistent focus. Mr. Gerspach reiterated that on Monday, saying the bank continued to make \u201csteady progress\u201d in its share of a \u201cclient\u2019s wallet.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Much of the gains in securities and banking came from Citigroup\u2019s investment banking unit, which was buoyed by increases in debt and equity underwriting. The unit\u2019s revenue increased to $1.1 billion, up 22 percent from the period a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    Over all, investors seemed pleased with the quarterly results. Citigroup\u2019s stock rose 9 cents to $44.87 on Monday, after trading in the morning above $46, on a day when there was wide selling in the stock market.

', u'\n                    Since the 2008 financial crisis, the banks\u2019 mortgage business had hinged on government intervention rather than fresh demand from consumers. When the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in recent years, it spurred millions of borrowers to refinance their home loans to reduce costs.        ', u'\n                    Now, as mortgage rates inch upward from their lows late last year and refinancing enthusiasm wanes, the pipeline of borrowers is drying up.

The results outpaced estimates of analysts polled by ', u', who had forecast earnings of 88 cents a share. For Wells, which is based in San Francisco, it was the 13th consecutive rise in quarterly earnings and the eighth consecutive record.

Shares in both banks fell, with JPMorgan dropping 30 cents, or 0.61 percent, to $49.01, and Wells Fargo sliding 30 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $37.21.        ', u'\n                    The results of both banks represented a turning point for their mortgage business. That business has been especially lucrative of late, as the banks pass on most loans to government entities like ', u' and ', u', which guarantee the loans will be repaid. Armed with the guarantee, the banks package and sell the mortgages to investors for a significant profit.

But the results on Friday signaled that those gains were unsustainable.        ', u'\n                    Underscoring a slowdown in refinancing, Wells Fargo said those loans accounted for 65 percent of mortgage originations in the first quarter, down from 76 percent in the period a year earlier. The bank\u2019s mortgage banking income also slipped 3 percent, presenting potential problems for Wells Fargo, whose fortunes rise and fall with the mortgage market. And while handling $109 billion in mortgage originations might be a feat for some banks, it was a 16 percent drop for Wells Fargo.

', u'\n                    With the mortgage business in transition, the banks found other ways to burnish profits. For one, they cut expenses. Both banks also notched big gains in credit card and automobile lending. At JPMorgan alone, car lending grew 12 percent from a year earlier, to $6.5 billion.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan\u2019s results were also buoyed by gains in the investment banking business, where fees rose 4 percent, to $1.4 billion. The asset management business, which JPMorgan has expanded as regulations crimp other areas of the bank, reported net income of $487 million for the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    The gains were further fueled by JPMorgan\u2019s decision to reduce reserves for mortgages and credit card loans. By moving money from the reserves, which cushion the bank against potential losses, the bank collected a net gain of 18 cents a share.

Just fill out ', u' and file it by April 15. (You can also ', u'). You don\u2019t have to give a reason for seeking the extra time. You\u2019ll then have until Oct. 15 to complete your tax return.        ', u'\n                    Last year, the Internal Revenue Service received roughly 10.7 million extension forms. (There are roughly 140 million tax filers each year.) Filing for an extension lets you avoid a late-filing penalty, usually 5 percent a month based on your unpaid balance.        ', u'\n                    But even if you file for an extension, that doesn\u2019t mean you have an extension on paying any taxes you may owe. You must, in effect, make your best estimate of what you owe on the extension form, and pay it. If you don\u2019t, you risk paying penalties and interest on what you owe.        ', u'\n                    Generally, you should file your taxes on time if you can, but there are valid reasons for seeking an extension, said Ed Mendlowitz, an accountant and partner with Withum Smith & Brown in South Brunswick, N.J., who blogged ', u'recently.        ', u'\n                    For instance, perhaps you didn\u2019t receive certain important forms, like a Schedule K-1, showing your share of profits or losses from a partnership. Or you have a complicated tax situation and want your tax preparer to have more time to complete your return in an unhurried manner. Or perhaps you are self-employed and want to establish and finance a Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Arrangement \u2014 a retirement plan for business owners and their employees \u2014 but you don\u2019t have the cash on hand. If you file for an extension, you can wait to set up the plan and put the money in by the extended filing deadline.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Mendlowitz said it was not true that filing for an extension would increase your chances of being audited. Indeed, he said, if you wait until October to file, you may slightly reduce your chances of being audited, because the I.R.S. is generally selecting returns for audit in late summer and early fall.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s important to note, he said, that requirements for an extension on your state tax return may be different. Some states, for instance, won\u2019t grant extensions to file if you owe money and don\u2019t pay at least a proportion of it by April 15, so you should check the rules for the state where you are filing.

When zombie stocks show signs of life, you know you are in trouble.        ', u'\n                    Some of you may be scratching your heads, wondering how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can even have stocks that still trade. After all, weren\u2019t Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ', u' during the financial crisis, gobbling up ', u' worth of federal money in the process? And hasn\u2019t the Obama administration said it ', u'?        ', u'\n                    Well, yes. The weird half-life of the mortgage finance giants is a result of the hoops the government went through during the financial crisis to avoid having the $5 trillion in debt being held by or guaranteed by the companies added to the actual federal debt.        ', u'\n                    The government could have fully nationalized and liquidated the companies. But if it did so, the government would have been legally deemed the owner or guarantor of the debt.        ', u'\n                    To avoid having to put the two companies on the government\u2019s balance sheet, the Treasury Department, led by ', u', decided instead to put the two into a legal purgatory known as a conservatorship. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under the supervision of their regulator. Despite being public wards, the companies have been largely run like private businesses, including paying their executives millions of dollars in compensation.        ', u'\n                    There was one exception, however. The government changed them from commercial entities with a goal of making money for stockholders into quasi-public service companies intended to help the housing mortgage market function. The government also expressly stated its goal was to eliminate the two companies and replace them with a new system of mortgage finance.        ', u'\n                    As part of all of this, the government lent the two entities almost $200 billion and received a right to acquire 79.9 percent of each company\u2019s stock. (It was set at this limit to avoid that pesky debt consolidation problem.)        ', u'\n                    All of this meant that while the companies were now under the government\u2019s thumb, the stocks still traded, left out there in an accounting maneuver worthy of the biggest multinational.        ', u'\n                    Since that time, the government has tried to damp down talk that the stocks might have any worth. They were delisted from the ', u', but still trade over the counter.        ', u'\n                    And boy do they trade. On an average day, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock have a combined volume of about 25 million shares. If the stocks were back on the New York Stock Exchange, they would be top-traded stocks.        ', u'\n                    Until a few months ago, the shares of the two companies traded like penny stocks in a range of 20 cents to 30 cents. That\u2019s a far cry from 2004, when both stocks were trading over $70 a share.        ', u'\n                    Since the beginning of the year, however, Fannie Mae shares have surged 238 percent, to more than 86 cents. Freddie Mac shares are up 211 percent year to date, at 81.9 cents. Both surges have come in the wake of Fannie Mae posting an annual 2012 profit of $17.2 billion and Freddie Mac also putting up a big profit number of $11 billion.        ', u'\n                    The companies\u2019 combined equity value is now about $7 billion according to S.& P. Capital IQ, although $5 billion of that is attributable to the government.        ', u'\n                    Still, $2 billion is nothing to laugh at, and the number stands despite a government that has gone out of its way to make the stocks worthless. The companies have eliminated voting and dividend rights on the shares. Not only that, as Fannie Mae states in its public filings, \u201cinstead of being run for the benefit of shareholders, our company is managed in the overall interest of taxpayers, which is consistent with the substantial public investment in us.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The federal government even has agreements with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that say that through 2017 they will turn over a set measure of profits to the government. After that, they will give all of their profits to the government.        ', u'\n                    Let\u2019s face it, what value is there in a stock where you have no vote, right to dividends or profits? Let alone the fact that each company is in debt to the government by over $160 billion. Then there is the government plan to shrink them, perhaps into nothing. The recent profits are rather meaningless in this light.        ', u'\n                    Yet the trading continues.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s not an entirely new phenomenon. There are companies in bankruptcy whose stocks trade until the bankruptcy process is completed. The old ', u', for example, traded for a couple of years as the ', u' before becoming worthless. In most circumstances, the equity then disappears without value, but along the way trading continues and the company still files reports with the ', u'. This practice has never been halted, and out of foolishness or pure speculation, shareholders continue to trade bankrupt shares.        ', u'\n                    Now, neither Fannie nor Freddie is in bankruptcy. But at least in bankruptcy cases there is a small chance that a shareholder may recover some money. With Fannie and Freddie, the government is deliberately allowing trading to go on in stock that the government is going out of its way to make worthless.        ', u'\n                    So here we have a situation where an investor buys something of no value in the hope of selling it for a greater amount to someone who believes the same.

When I asked a representative of American Funds, that person cited a policy of not commenting on particular investments.

It\u2019s been quite profitable so far, but as we have seen again and again, trading based on froth and not on value almost always ends badly.

People spend an estimated 10 percent of their media attention staring at their smartphones and tablets, but mobile advertising accounts for a small fraction of 1 percent of total advertising spending.\n        ', u'\n                    \nYet from a small base, mobile ad spending is expected to grow rapidly. IDC estimates that mobile advertising will surge from $4.5 billion last year to $12 billion by 2015.        ', u'\n                    Advertisers will follow the online audience to mobile, but will they be doing it blindly? Audience measurement and targeting in mobile devices, where apps rule, is way behind the Web.        ', u'\n                    Many companies are working on overcoming this mobile ad challenge, including the two giants in mobile software technology with their own operating systems and apps stores: Google and Apple. Yet a start-up, Mobilewalla, has an intriguing, Big Data approach to the problem.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is develop a scientific way to measure app audiences,\u201d said Anindya Datta, a founder and chief executive of Mobilewalla. \u201cIt is a very hard problem.\u201d        ', u'\n                    And an important one. The promise of Internet advertising is that the measurement and targeting of audiences is vastly superior to that in traditional advertising. But in mobile, where Apple and Android applications are the windows for so much viewing, audience tracking is far more difficult. Unlike the Web, where the code \u2014 so-called cookies \u2014 for identifying Internet addresses is in browser software, mobile apps lack a similar tracking tool.        ', u'\n                    \u201cSpray and pray\u201d is how ad industry experts describe most mobile campaigns. That problem could hold back the growth curve of mobile ad spending. \u201cIf you can\u2019t target ads, the utility is greatly diminished,\u201d said Karsten Weide, an analyst at IDC.        ', u'\n                    Mobilewalla\u2019s data scientists and engineers, Mr. Datta said, have created a way to pull and sift through more than two billion consumer reviews on app stores, Twitter messages and Facebook public profiles and posts. It also gets information from app publishers who agree to share user information.        ', u'\n                    The Mobilewalla team is looking for signals of sentiment and correlations in the data to try to make accurate predictions about the demographic characteristics of people using certain apps, and point to correlations and clusters of users. Its technology is a variant of the \u201ccollaborative filtering\u201d techniques used by Amazon and Netflix to make recommendations. It uses machine-learning software to find apps that share similar audiences and then humans to refine the algorithms.        ', u'\n                    For example, the ESPN app and Univision Sports app were initially in the same cluster as sports apps. But 90 percent of the ESPN users are English speakers and 78 percent of Univision\u2019s are native Spanish speakers, Mr. Datta said. They are not the same demographic group at all. So the software is tweaked accordingly.        ', u'\n                    The kindred apps can be quirky. For example, Mr. Datta said, his company\u2019s research shows the Bible! app (published by Logos Bible Software) has a significant audience overlap with apps called Slotsjourney (FishStick Games), Slotmania \u2014 Slot Machine (Playtika LTD), and Slots by Zynga (Zynga). Religious Christians, Mr. Datta said, seem to like to gamble, especially playing slots.        ', u'\n                    Another: the Drudge Report app overlaps considerably with the Domino\u2019s Pizza app. Republicans, Mr. Datta said, apparently prefer Domino\u2019s pizza. But the Pizza Hut app has a different audience.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s how they are attacking the problem that seems novel,\u201d said Ramesh Jain, a computer scientist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThey are treating this as a Big Data problem, working with huge metrics of people expressing their sentiments about apps.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The challenge is magnified by the growth and volatility of mobile apps. Every week, as about 100 new movies and 250 new books are introduced worldwide, about 15,000 smartphone apps are added to apps stores around the globe.        ', u'\n                    The churn of what\u2019s rising or falling in popularity is accelerated in smartphone apps. The turnover rate among the 100 most popular mobile apps, according to Mobilewalla\u2019s calculations, is 45 percent after 30 days and 85 percent after 90 days \u2014 double or triple of the churn rates in television or even Web sites.        ', u'\n                    Thus, a tried-and-true method of measuring audience in television and on the Web \u2014 observing the viewing behavior of panels of users \u2014 does not work for mobile apps, Mr. Datta said. The panel approach relies on persistent popularity over weeks or longer. In mobile apps, that kind of stability does not exist.        ', u'\n                    Mobilewalla demonstrated its technology last month at the American Association of Advertising Agencies convention in New Orleans. And a major mobile-display ad network, InMobi, has been using the Mobilewalla technology for a couple of months. \u201cWe use Mobilewalla to look for apps that are trending upward, to find publishers that look promising as new business prospects, and to add more color as we look for user clusters for audience mapping,\u201d said Shrikant Latkar, vice president of global marketing for InMobi.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Latkar noted that InMobi also uses other technology tools to target audiences, like AdTruth, a software that can recognize what mobile devices people are using. \u201cIt all enriches the feed into our data store,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Mobilewalla is based in Seattle, with teams in Singapore and India. Founded in 2010, the company has been backed by angel investors, including Rajan Anandan, the chief executive of Google in India. Earlier this year, it raised its first round of venture capital, led by Madrona Venture Group in Seattle.

I don\u2019t ever \u201cwithdraw\u201d money from my account. Since I had previously set up a monthly transfer from my outside checking account into my Capital One account (actually, ING Direct, when I\u2019d first done it), I\u2019d simply set up automatic transfers of $5 a week from my savings account to the girls\u2019 subaccounts, for their allowances.

(There\u2019s no limits on funds coming in, just going out.) Or, I could open a new Capital One 360 checking account, which doesn\u2019t limit withdrawals.        ', u'\n                    I chose the second option. The point of the online transfers is for my children to watch the balance grow week by week, and I fear I\u2019d lose an incentive to discuss their money with them regularly if I reduced the frequency of deposits. As it is, I sometimes forget to show them their balances anyway.

', u'\n                    So in 1986, he joined Wall Street, moving not to the trading floor, like many of his fellow rocket scientists, but into risk management.

', u'\n                    That debacle encapsulates much of what is wrong about how banks manage their risk and how the regulators oversee those efforts. At JPMorgan Chase, the risk models hid \u2014 and were used to hide \u2014 risks from the traders and top executives. Too many measures and too many numbers undid the risk managers. But ultimately, they failed because of human frailties; the risk managers lost sight of their mission and tried to protect the traders and their trades. As in all spy debacles, the counterintelligence officers got co-opted.        ', u'\n                    Early in his career, Mr. Breit figured out that models for markets aren\u2019t like those for physics. They don\u2019t come from nature. It was necessary to know the math, if only so that he couldn\u2019t be intimidated by the quantitative analysts.        ', u'\n                    But the numbers more often disguise risk than reveal it. \u201cI went down the statistical path,\u201d he said. He built one of the first value-at-risk models, or VaR, a mathematical formula that is supposed to distill how much risk a firm is running at any given point.        ', u'\n                    The only thing from capital markets math he came to embrace was this immutable law of nature: investors make money by taking risk. \u201cIf it\u2019s profitable and seems riskless, it\u2019s a business you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he told me.        ', u'\n                    Instead of fixating on models, risk managers need to develop what spies call humint \u2014 human intelligence from flesh and blood sources. They need to build networks of people who will trust them enough to report when things seem off, before they become spectacular problems. Mr. Breit, who attributes this approach to his mentor, Daniel Napoli, the former head of risk at Merrill Lynch, took people out drinking to get them to open up. He cultivated junior accountants.

Most traders who get into trouble, he thinks, aren\u2019t bad guys. The bad ones, who try to cover up improper trades, are relatively easy to detect.

', u'\n                    The problem, as Mr. Breit sees it, is that this has nothing to do with how risk management is practiced today, or what the regulators encourage.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a well-known plaintiffs\u2019 firm that has made a name for itself by aggressively filing shareholder lawsuits against companies related to executive pay as well as mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Monteverde has helped pioneer a relatively new type of plaintiffs\u2019 action called \u201csay on pay,\u201d which relates to Dodd-Frank reforms over executive compensation issues.        ', u'\n                    The counterclaim filed by Mr. Monteverde and his firm is as sensational as the original complaint, describing in excruciating detail several instances of sexual contact between Mr. Monteverde and Ms. Marchuk, who has left the firm.        ', u'\n                    The first encounter took place after Ms. Marchuk accompanied Mr. Monteverde to Wilmington for a hearing at the Delaware Court of Chancery, according to the counterclaim.

At a bar after the office party, Mr. Monteverde and Ms. Marchuk were seen kissing and fondling one other. At 3 a.m., the two went back to the law firm\u2019s offices, the complaint said. The sexual contact that transpired fell short of intercourse and was entirely consensual, according to the countersuit.        ', u'\n                    Less than a week later, Ms. Marchuk resigned.

Still, the new move may reduce spontaneity because companies may limit their communications to official corporate accounts and file the information with the agency at the same time.        ', u'\n                    With the decision, the S.E.C is playing catch-up to the new era of social media.

In the note, Mr. Hastings congratulated his team for exceeding one billion hours of video watched in a single month.        ', u'\n                    But the federal agency raised concerns that the post violated ', u', commonly known as Reg FD, which requires a company to publish material information to all investors at the same time. While Mr. Hastings\u2019s announcement was made on his publicly available Facebook page, which had over 200,000 followers, the information was not subsequently disclosed in a securities filing or news release.        ', u'\n                    At the time, Mr. Hastings and Netflix said that his message was both immaterial and readily available to investors, having been picked up by a number of blogs and news media outlets. \u201cWe use blogging and social media, including Facebook, to communicate effectively with the public and our members,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote \u2014 on his Facebook page, naturally \u2014 after disclosing the investigation last year.        ', u'\n                    Now, the S.E.C. seems to be relaxing its stance.        ', u'\n                    After an investigation of several months, regulators said that companies could treat social media as legitimate outlets for communication, much like corporate Web sites or the agency\u2019s own public filing system called Edgar. The catch is that corporations have to make clear which Twitter feeds or Facebook pages will serve as potential outlets for announcements.

', u'\n                    In developing its rules, the agency also let Mr. Hastings avoid sanctions for his Facebook post. Neither the chief executive nor Netflix incurred any penalties since receiving the so-called Wells notice from the agency in December.        ', u'\n                    Instead, the regulator issued what is known as a report of investigation, used on the rare occasion when it wants to issue broad guidance from a specific investigation. As part of its release, the agency reiterated its goal for Reg FD, namely making sure that investors receive important information at the same time.

', u'\n                    As in the past, the S.E.C. is treading carefully in its corporate disclosure policies. In 2008, the regulator clarified that corporate Web sites alone could qualify as wide disclosure if investors already knew that those pages could be sources of material information.

Welcome to the newest trend in activist investing: hedge funds paying their nominees to a company\u2019s board as if they were chief executives.\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe latest examples can be found in two prominent proxy fights. In the first, Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management has acquired about $800 million in stock of the ', u', the integrated oil company. The hedge fund has nominated five directors to the 14-member Hess board and is agitating for change, arguing that the company has substantially underperformed its peers by 460 percent over the last 17 years.        ', u'\n                    In the second, Barry Rosenstein\u2019s Jana Partners is storming the ramparts of Agrium, acquiring about 7.5 percent of the company, an agriculture supply retailer and wholesaler based in Calgary, Alberta. Jana, which contends Agrium has underperformed its peers by 160 percent over the last five years, has nominated five directors to the company\u2019s 12-member board.        ', u'\n                    Agitating for changes and waging proxy fights are familiar pages from the activist investor playbook. What\u2019s different here is that each hedge fund is promising to pay its director candidates what are essentially bonuses that could run into millions of dollars, if not more.        ', u'\n                    In Elliott\u2019s case, its five nominees will be paid a $50,000 retainer, a mere tip. The kicker is that any of its nominees who win a seat on the Hess board and serve for a year will be paid an aggregate $30,000 for each percentage point the stock price of Hess outperforms a peer group of stocks over three years from January 2013, when the stock was trading at about $58 a share (it\u2019s at $70 now). The total potential payment tops out at $9 million for each director \u2014 or 300 percent outperformance, an admittedly fantastic return for everyone if it occurs.        ', u'\n                    Jana is paying its nominees in a more direct and potentially more lucrative manner. Jana\u2019s nominees also get $50,000 each, but they will receive 2.6 percent of Jana\u2019s net profit from the price of Agrium shares as of Sept. 27, 2012, if they are elected (Agrium\u2019s stock then was $102.99 in New York, and is currently trading a few dollars below that). If they are not elected, they will still receive 1.8 percent of Jana\u2019s net profit. The hedge fund\u2019s investment is about $1 billion, so we are talking about potential millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars.        ', u'\n                    Any way you slice it, Jana and Elliott are raising the ante for director compensation. A ', u' found that the average director made $134,000 in annual cash and incentive compensation from 2006 to 2010. And this week, Susanne Craig of The New York Times reported that some ', u' directors ', u'. That\u2019s a nice sum, but these hedge fund-nominated directors stand to make much more.        ', u'\n                    Not surprisingly, both Agrium and Hess are up in arms about the hedge funds\u2019 plans to pay their nominees. They make two basic arguments.        ', u'\n                    The first is that the hedge fund directors are not independent. Because the directors are being paid by the hedge fund, they will be loyal to the hedge fund, rather than the company.        ', u'\n                    The second is that by paying these directors large sums over three years, the hedge fund nominees will aim for short-term performance and not care what happens to the company in the longer term.        ', u'\n                    The counterargument has been put forth most forcefully by Jana. The hedge fund argues that the compensation system is hard-wired. Jana (and Elliott, for that matter) have already agreed to pay these amounts and can\u2019t renege, so the directors are no longer beholden to the hedge fund, if they ever were.        ', u'\n                    Jana also contends that its compensation arrangement is better than other kinds of director pay, since it better aligns the company\u2019s performance with the directors\u2019.        ', u'\n                    Elliott echoed this, saying in a statement: \u201cThere is no link to any plan, there is no discretion by Elliott, and the term is longer than any compensation offered by Hess. In other words, there is complete alignment with long-term shareholders\u2019 interests.\u201d        ', u'\n                    So who is right?        ', u'\n                    First, as long as the arrangement is disclosed and the hedge funds don\u2019t exert any future control over the nominees, it is unlikely that this violates any state or federal law. Here, director compensation falls into the same basket as ', u'.        ', u'\n                    The examples of hedge funds paying directors are all over the place.        ', u'\n                    Some funds, like Pershing Square Capital Management, do not directly compensate nominees. Other funds pay just a flat fee of $50,000 to $150,000. And then there are arrangements like the one ', u' had with Frank J. Biondi Jr., the former chief executive ', u', during Mr. Icahn\u2019s battle with ', u' in 2006.

', u'\n                    But what Mr. Schwarzman did next, thanks to Dell\u2019s disclosure, may go a long way toward explaining what\u2019s truly going on: Blackstone told Dell that it would not even consider bidding for the company unless Dell offered to pay the firm\u2019s expenses, up to a whopping $25 million.        ', u'\n                    Yes, you read that correctly. Blackstone demanded that Dell pay it to go through the motions of bidding.        ', u'\n                    Here it is in the proxy: \u201cThe Blackstone consortium informed the special committee that it was not willing to proceed with its evaluation of the transaction contemplated\u201d unless \u201cit received an agreement from the company to reimburse the Blackstone consortium\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its evaluation of a possible transaction.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Here\u2019s what\u2019s not in the proxy: Originally, Blackstone did not demand to be reimbursed for just out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 for consultants, travel and the like \u2014 but also sought to be able to receive payments for the time of its own executives, according to people involved in the process. Just think about it: How much would Mr. Schwarzman bill for his time? $10,000 an hour?        ', u'\n                    Ultimately, Dell\u2019s special committee agreed to pay Blackstone\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses but not hourly fees or contingency fees for its banking advisers. (By the way, the special committee also agreed to pay Silver Lake the same reimbursement to make the process fair.)        ', u'\n                    The fact that Blackstone refused to bid unless its costs were covered by Dell \u2014 a highly unusual maneuver \u2014 just goes to show you how little confidence it has that it expects to submit a winning bid for Dell.        ', u'\n                    Blackstone also required Dell to indemnify the firm from any lawsuits stemming from its involvement in the auction process, according to Dell\u2019s documents.        ', u'\n                    For Dell\u2019s special committee, agreeing to these bold demands from Blackstone is probably good business. If the board can keep a second bidder at the table, even if the suitor never makes a firm bid, Dell\u2019s special committee will have insulated itself from criticism that it did not run a competitive process.        ', u'\n                    The real question is why, despite the $25 million reimbursement guarantee, Blackstone is risking its reputation to even contemplate a deal for Dell.        ', u'\n                    If Blackstone makes a formal bid \u2014 and so far it has not lined up financing \u2014 it will most likely be competing against a bid from Mr. Dell. While Blackstone has clearly been invited into the auction process, if Mr. Dell quits or is ousted as a result of a winning bid from Blackstone, the firm will appear to have made a hostile bid. Private equity firms have spent the last 25 years avoiding anything that could make them perceived as hostile because they typically want management teams to want to do business with them.        ', u'\n                    Last week, two Blackstone partners, Chinh Chu and David Johnson, who recently defected from Dell, met with Mr. Dell at his home. Mr. Dell is said to be open to working with Blackstone if they can agree on strategy, operations and corporate governance.        ', u'\n                    But by the looks of it, Blackstone and Mr. Dell are coming to the table from entirely different angles. Mr. Dell wants to keep the company intact and reinvest in developing the personal computer, tablet and emerging-market business. Blackstone\u2019s strategy appears to center on selling Dell\u2019s financing arm \u2014 it received some interest from GE Capital \u2014 and focusing on its services business.        ', u'\n                    What happens if Mr. Dell comes out with the following statement? \u201cUnfortunately, after holding talks with Blackstone in good faith, I can\u2019t participate in their transaction because of a disagreement over strategy. Their plan is a short-term and shortsighted effort to break up the company and put in peril Dell\u2019s more than 100,000 employees.\u201d        ', u'\n                    All of sudden, Blackstone would look like a barbarian at the gate in a big and very public nasty battle. (Some would claim Mr. Dell was being selfish, but the damage would be done \u2014 to Blackstone.)        ', u'\n                    Alternatively, is it really possible Blackstone would try to embrace Mr. Dell and make him the chief executive \u2014 which they have said they are open to doing? Blackstone has already been canvassing for other candidates. In fact, the firm contacted Mark Hurd of Oracle before ever even discussing the matter with Mr. Dell, which, of course, was a not-so-great way to ingratiate itself with a potential future partner.        ', u'\n                    And then there\u2019s the ownership stakes. Mr. Dell owns about 15 percent of the equity in Dell. It is almost impossible to believe that Blackstone would put in more equity than Mr. Dell already has in the company. That would leave Blackstone as a smaller equity owner than Mr. Dell himself. Would Blackstone really team up with him and let him have control of the company?        ', u'\n                    All of these questions have no good answers. But for $25 million in reimbursed expenses, maybe they don\u2019t need them.        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

That, analysts said, would mean a new approach to the lucrative U.S. market in the aftermath of the failed BAE merger.        ', u'\n                    It would also require casting a close eye over its underperforming \u2014 and heavily German \u2014 defense division, Cassidian.

Cassidian, he noted, owns significant, but not controlling, stakes in some of Europe\u2019s biggest military joint ventures, including Eurofighter, the producer of the Typhoon combat jet, and MBDA, a missile manufacturer, as well as niche activities in military electronics and security.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s very fragmented,\u201d Mr. Tusa said. \u201cSome of those areas have synergies, but with most it\u2019s hard to see how they really fit together into a coherent whole.\u201d        ', u'\n                    It has also not been hugely profitable. Like most military contractors in recent years, Cassidian, which contributed about half of EADS\u2019s \u20ac12 billion, or $15 billion, in defense revenue last year, has seen its growth stalled by sharp budget cutbacks in Europe and the United States. Stagnant earnings have prompted two restructurings of the unit since 2011, resulting in the loss of about 1,500 jobs. Cassidian\u2019s operating profit plunged 57 percent last year, to \u20ac142 million.        ', u'\n                    That contrasts sharply with EADS\u2019s booming commercial jet division, Airbus, which last year increased its sales 19 percent, representing 68 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. Operating profit more than doubled, to \u20ac1.1 billion from \u20ac543 million in 2011. Airbus\u2019s order backlog stands at more than 4,700 planes, enough to keep its assembly lines humming for nearly eight years.        ', u'\n                    Hence the temptation, some analysts say, to spin off EADS\u2019s military business entirely and either sell or merge its various activities with those of rival companies based mainly in France, Britain or Italy.

It certainly is your responsibility as a pet owner to make sure you can provide and pay for basic veterinary care to your animal, along with food, toys, and lots of love.  But not everyone can foot the bill for, say, a kidney transplant for their cat, or an amputation for their dog.  Could you put it on a credit card? Would that hurt you financially? If you do pay for a high-cost surgery, will you be able to stay with and care for your pet while it recovers at home? You have to make those decisions, in consultation with your vet. But don\u2019t be shy about asking your veterinarian about all the options available to you.  You may want to set up a separate savings account, like a pet emergency fund, to prepare for inevitable medical costs for your pet(s).        ', u'\n                    Q.

But if you love your pet, and have given it a wonderful life, you have to trust yourself to make the right decision. As we noted in the story, you also need to consider what kind of life your pet would have even if you pay to extend it through extraordinary measures. You also need to factor in what kinds of spending and saving decisions you will have to make if you do go into debt to save your pet. There is no one right answer for anyone. At a certain point, your heart will guide you just as much as your wallet will.        ', u'\n                    Q.

The best way, just as with humans, is to keep current with annual checkups, and go to the veterinarian as soon as you think there may be something wrong. It\u2019s always more expensive to treat an illness is advanced stages than it is to keep something from becoming a full-blown crisis.        ', u'\n                    You should also shop around for veterinary care. Call a few and ask what they charge for a basic exam (that is, to walk in the door). Ask friends who have pets what they pay for checkups and emergency care. Based on an admittedly unscientific survey (my friends), the average cost of an annual checkup in my area of Los Angeles is $50. It may be different where you live, but talking with other pet owners will give you a sense of what to expect. The ASPCA has a ', u', including medical.

You can often save money, and avoid a significant markup at the veterinarian\u2019s office, by ordering the medicine online. Or go to a store like Walgreens or Target to have the prescription filled. Target even has a special program called PetRx that includes $4 generics.        ', u'\n                    Emergency care is another story, though. When your pet is in critical condition, you won\u2019t be in a position to shop around. So look up the pet hospitals nearest you and do some research on your own before something happens to your pet. And never be afraid to ask about cost before your pet is taken away for surgery or any other procedure. For most of us, cost has to be a factor in our decision-making around pet care, and veterinary care providers know that.        ', u'\n                    Q.

In these cases, having pet insurance may make those decisions a little easier since some of the costs will be defrayed.

A phone with a strong Facebook focus would prompt customers to use Facebook more than competing apps and services. But the success of such a device would depend on how much support the handset received from wireless carriers, said Chetan Sharma, an independent telecommunications analyst who consults for carriers.

He said it would be better for Facebook to create a special layer that consumers could install on Android devices so the social network would embed more deeply into Android apps and Google services.

This year the company introduced Poke, a private messaging service, as a stand-alone app. Last year, it released a camera app that specialized in tagging and uploading photos to Facebook. In 2011, it introduced Messenger, an app for free text messaging, which was later expanded to include free voice calls.

But the project, which was at one time code-named \u201cBuffy,\u201d had stalled because the company could not decide whether to make its own hardware or team up with a phone maker.        ', u'\n                    Facebook\u2019s approach to modifying Google\u2019s Android software is similar to Amazon\u2019s, said a former employee of Facebook who had been briefed on the product. For its Kindle Fire tablets, Amazon removed Google\u2019s apps and promoted its own services, like the Kindle e-book store, Amazon\u2019s video service and Amazon\u2019s own app store. The tablet is essentially an Amazon-powered shopping console.

Just a little feedback sharpens my focus.

', u'\n                    This seems like a simple thing. In fact, when it comes to improving our financial situation, it feels as if it\u2019s too simple. So we don\u2019t do it. I wonder if something super simple, like tracking a single number, consistently and for a long time, may be the subtle nudge we need to improve our finances.        ', u'\n                    Most of the people I talk to, regardless of income or net worth, have no budget or financial plan. So it\u2019s pretty clear that anything that we can do consistently will be better than the nothing we\u2019re currently doing.        ', u'\n                    So the question I have is: How simple can we make this process and still see improvement?

', u'\n                    The default answer is usually spending, but the idea of tracking spending makes people think of budgeting, and budgeting has a marketing problem \u2014 very few people like to do it. But it can be effective and simple.        ', u'\n                    Take 10 minutes at the end of each day and record what you spent. Use a notebook or your favorite app and track it. Over time, you start to see patterns. You learn things you didn\u2019t know about yourself in terms of what your spending says about your priorities. That will naturally lead to change.        ', u'\n                    One of the reasons I focus on spending is that people think tracking doesn\u2019t help. A great (or not so great) example is the time I taught a financial literacy class to people who were working their way out of the local homeless shelter. The first week, 20 people would show up. I gave them a pocket-size spiral notebook and asked them to record everything they spent for one week and to come back so we could move onto the next step. No one ever came back. After a few weeks, we canceled the class.        ', u'\n                    And it\u2019s not just people in the homeless shelter who seem to have issues when you mention tracking spending. Most of the people I talk to who make more than $100,000 a year and have money invested think they are way beyond budgeting. So they don\u2019t do it either.        ', u'\n                    But maybe what you spend each day is the wrong number to focus on.        ', u'\n                    What about tracking a different number like the value of your savings, investments and retirement account? Once a week, you add up the balances and write down that number. Measure it over time. Just one piece of paper with a simple line graph.        ', u'\n                    Would that lead to change?        ', u'\n                    I like this idea because it\u2019s what many of us are focused on: having enough money saved to meet some future goal like sending your children to college or retirement. It seems to me that by just focusing on that one number, a lot of the noise goes away.        ', u'\n                    Another idea would be even simpler. Track the amount you are able to able to save each week or month. That\u2019s a number that gets rid of the short-term variation that comes from the market and focuses clearly on something that we have control over \u2014 how much we save. In theory, if you focus on that one number, you will find ways to improve it. That could mean you will find ways to spend less, earn more, or both. Because you want to see that number go up.

', u'\n                    It\u2019s a sign that Chinese companies are growing up. As the country\u2019s economy continues to open up, private sector businesses have looked to foreign investment to finance their expansion efforts, rather than relying on hard-to-get loans from the state-controlled banks.        ', u'\n                    The junk bond market in China took off this year. Although the deals still account for a small share of the global total, Chinese companies have sold $8 billion of high-yield bonds to overseas investors since January. That\u2019s up from $2.3 billion during the same period a year earlier, according to figures from Dealogic.        ', u'\n                    \u201cBond markets are booming because companies have had difficulty getting the level of debt they want out of banks onshore or offshore, and in tapping equity markets,\u201d said Nick Gronow, a senior managing director at ', u' in Hong Kong and an expert in Chinese bankruptcies. \u201cSo bonds have really taken up the slack.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But the pace of growth is troubling to some analysts.        ', u'\n                    As investors have plowed into junk bonds across the globe, yields have plummeted. In the United States, rates on junk bonds have dipped below 6 percent, compared with historical payouts of roughly 10 percent or more.        ', u'\n                    The trend is similar in China.        ', u'\n                    Country Garden, a builder based in the southern city of Guangzhou, raised $750 million in January by selling 10-year bonds that paid 7.5 percent a year. In 2011, the company sold $900 million of seven-year bonds at a much higher 11.125 percent.        ', u'\n                    The borrowing costs for Kaisa Group Holdings, a commercial real estate company in the southern city of Shenzhen, have also dropped rapidly. In September, it sold $250 million of five-year bonds at 12.875 percent. By January, it was able to sell $500 million of bonds at 10.25 percent. This month, it issued new bonds at 8.875 percent.        ', u'\n                    \u201cChinese real estate issuance is happening for structural reasons: 50 percent of the population needs to be urbanized and housed, traditional funding from banks may be more restricted now, and global appetite for yield is on the rise,\u201d said Gregorio Saichin, the London-based head of emerging markets and high-yield, fixed-income portfolio management at Pioneer Investments. \u201cWhen you combine all the above factors with a massive refinancing exercise by Chinese property developers, you get this type of outcome.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But it\u2019s a slim difference in yields for such disparate markets.        ', u'\n                    Chinese high-yield bonds have many of the same characteristics \u2014 and risks \u2014 as American debt. They tend to be sold by companies looking to finance ventures in new or untested areas or businesses that compete in industries where earnings are subject to volatile swings.        ', u'\n                    But the Chinese market has its own set of potential problems, and some analysts worry that investors aren\u2019t being properly compensated for the added layer of risks.        ', u'\n                    For one, the bulk of the high-yield bonds in Asia this year \u2014 roughly half \u2014 come from Chinese real estate companies. The fear is that the housing market, which has been booming, is a bubble that will eventually burst.        ', u'\n                    The industry is especially uncertain, given the periodic government intervention. On March 1, Beijing announced new measures to curb excess in the market, including the strict enforcement of a 20 percent capital gains tax on the sale of preowned homes.

', u'\n                    Mainland China\u2019s domestic bond market remains largely off limits to foreign buyers. So most investors buy offshore Chinese bonds, which are issued through holding companies headquartered in places like the Cayman Islands.        ', u'\n                    The bonds tend not to be backed by the actual businesses and underlying assets in mainland China. That means foreign bondholders may have little legal recourse if a company defaults on its debt, especially if local banks or other Chinese creditors make claims.        ', u'\n                    Bondholders are now facing such difficulties with the bankruptcy of Suntech Power.        ', u'\n                    Earlier this month, Suntech, the world\u2019s largest solar panel maker, stopped making payments on $541 million in convertible bonds largely held by foreign investors, including Pioneer Investments. On March 21, a court in Wuxi, a city in eastern China, accepted a bankruptcy petition filed by eight Chinese banks against Suntech\u2019s main operating unit in China, a group that is seeking to recoup some of the money it lent to the company.        ', u'\n                    If previous Chinese bankruptcies are any indicator, those local banks will take priority in the so-called liquidation process, while foreign bondholders may lose everything. \u201cThe greatest difficulty the bondholders have, when things go wrong, is what leverage do they actually have against the company?\u201d Mr. Gronow of FTI Consulting said.        ', u'\n                    The answer, usually, is not much. Mr. Gronow cites the case of Asia Aluminum, a manufacturer in the small southern city of Zhaoqing that collapsed in 2009 after accumulating more than $1.7 billion in debt.        ', u'\n                    After several months of often strained negotiations between the company, mainland and Hong Kong banks, foreign bondholders and the government, Mr. Gronow and his co-workers, acting as liquidators, worked out a deal that gave back Asia Aluminum\u2019s bank creditors in Hong Kong 100 percent of their capital.        ', u'\n                    Others were not so lucky. The owners of bonds issued by one offshore subsidiary received about 20 cents on the dollar. And investors in riskier \u201cpayment-in-kind\u201d notes, a sort of hybrid bond where interest payments can be made by selling more debt, received only about 1 cent on the dollar.

', u'\n                    Mr. Zucker has declined interview requests since taking over as chief executive of CNN Worldwide in January. But his pairing of Mr. Cuomo, 42, and Ms. Bolduan, 29, suggests that he sees an opening for a morning show that is generationally different \u2014 or, to put it more bluntly, a morning show that has younger faces.

Mr. Murphy, whose hiring was announced internally in February, said in a telephone interview that the CNN program would be a \u201cwide-ranging morning show.\u201d        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe\u2019re not going to reinvent the wheel,\u201d he said, seemingly trying to manage expectations. \u201cBut what we will provide people, I think, is a fresher, more energetic, more conversational and more interesting morning show than what they\u2019re used to.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some of the specifics about the format and the content are still being sorted out, Mr. Murphy said. But he indicated that the new show \u201cwill not be all politics like MSNBC is,\u201d referring to \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d or \u201cas consistently about social issues as Fox is,\u201d referring to \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Both \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cFox & Friends\u201d routinely outperform \u201cStarting Point\u201d in ratings, which may be part of the reason why Mr. Zucker has decided to start over from scratch and make a new show. \u201cStarting Point\u201d was plagued by executive-level disagreements about what the show should and shouldn\u2019t be. Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s associates complained that the show wasn\u2019t supported internally or promoted externally.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Zucker and Mr. Murphy seem determined not to repeat those missteps. Mr. Murphy said in the interview that \u201cwe really did cast a wide net\u201d as the new management considered possible co-hosts for Mr. Cuomo.        ', u'\n                    Of Ms. Bolduan, he said, \u201cIt is a surprising choice, and we know that.\u201d That\u2019s because Mr. Zucker originally planned to pair Mr. Cuomo with Erin Burnett, a better-known host who CNN hired away from CNBC two years ago. But the plan fell apart, reportedly due to Ms. Burnett\u2019s unwillingness to move to the morning time slot. She currently hosts a 7 p.m. newscast, \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d        ', u'\n                    CNN executives portrayed this as a good thing, because it led them to Ms. Bolduan, who wowed Mr. Zucker and his lieutenants. Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Bolduan had obvious chemistry when they tried hosting together in an internal test, and that\u2019s what morning producers look for when they put people together.        ', u'\n                    Ms. Bolduan, who at 29 will be the youngest morning host on any major television network, will move to New York from Washington for the new job. She is currently a congressional correspondent for CNN. She joined the channel in 2007 as a correspondent for the CNN service that provides news to local television stations. She was promoted to the main channel in 2009. Ms. Bolduan has gained a little bit of hosting experience lately by co-hosting one hour of \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d in Washington. But she hasn\u2019t anchored elsewhere, so the new morning show could have something of a learning curve.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt is a huge opportunity to work on this new show,\u201d she said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cKnowing that we have the resources of some of the most experienced executives in the business, the backing of a brand like CNN, and to be able to sit alongside such great people as Chris and Michaela \u2014 I can\u2019t think of a better combination.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Executives at CNN have said they know \u2014 and they want others to know \u2014 that the rebuilding of the channel\u2019s daily schedule will take time. But the channel\u2019s recent ratings lows suggest that it is primed for a comeback of sorts. \u201cStarting Point,\u201d for instance, averaged just 234,000 viewers last year, CNN\u2019s lowest total viewer number in that time slot in more than a decade.

If it has been financed by a European bank, the answer may be yes.\n        ', u'\n                    \nA glut of ships, and slack demand for shipping in the weak global economy, have reduced the value of cargo ships.

And with cargo fees near record lows, many vessels are not earning enough to make debt payments, either.        ', u'\n                    As European leaders agonize about how to rescue Cyprus banks, the formerly obscure world of ship finance is a reminder of how much cleanup still lies ahead for the region\u2019s banks. The growing fear is that some lenders, almost all of them in Europe, have yet to confront the scale of potential losses from an estimated $350 billion in loans made to the shipping industry.        ', u'\n                    \u201cMany banks are still shackled by the leftover effects of the crisis,\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the ', u', told an audience in Frankfurt this week, without identifying any specific assets. \u201cThis is the weak link in the chain of recovery.\u201d She urged banks to take a harder look at their problem loans.        ', u'\n                    Whether the risk from shipping loans is serious enough to put another torpedo into the euro zone financial system is hard to say because of a glaring lack of detailed information about banks\u2019 portfolios of shipping loans.        ', u'\n                    Andreas R. Dombret, a member of the executive board of the German Bundesbank who is responsible for monitoring financial stability, said he thought the shipping crisis, while serious, did not pose a broad threat to the euro zone. \u201cIt\u2019s not a concern for the stability of the financial system,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not systemic.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But he and other bank overseers are stepping up pressure on financial institutions to address their problems. Shipping is \u201ca substantial regional and sectoral risk in the banking industry,\u201d Mr. Dombret warned at an industry gathering in Hamburg last month. It was one of the few times a bank overseer of his stature had expressed concern about the shipping problem.        ', u'\n                    Under pressure from regulators, local governments that own most of HSH Nordbank in Hamburg said on Tuesday that they would raise their guarantees for the bank to 10 billion euros ($13 billion), from 7 billion euros ($9 billion). Though only a midsize bank, HSH is the biggest lender to the shipping industry, with more than $39 billion in outstanding loans. The announcement, by the City of Hamburg and State of Schleswig-Holstein, amounted to an admission that losses from shipping were greater than earlier estimates.        ', u'\n                    The shipping downturn, which began in 2008, has already driven several large fleet operators into bankruptcy. The Overseas Shipholding Group, the largest American tanker operator, filed for bankruptcy in November. The fear is that some of the banks most active in ship finance, which are concentrated in Germany, Scandinavia and Britain, are in denial about potential losses.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most serious commercial problem that the banks have,\u201d said Paul Slater, chairman of the First International Corporation, a consulting firm in Naples, Fla., that specializes in shipping. Banks with large portfolios of shipping loans \u201care just not taking the hits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are saying, \u2018Give it time and it will work out,\u2019 and it\u2019s just not going to do that.\u201d        ', u'\n                    For weak banks, the temptation to play down potential losses may be great. A frank appraisal of their losses would force some to raise billions in new capital or even to declare insolvency. That is true not only of shipping loans but also of other categories like commercial real estate, and it remains a fundamental problem for the euro zone economy.        ', u'\n                    The uncertainty about banks\u2019 true financial health fosters mistrust among institutions, makes them reluctant to lend to each other and is partly responsible for a shortage of credit for businesses and consumers.        ', u'\n                    As sour assets go, ships are particularly troublesome. Unlike a plot of land, they require costly maintenance. They lose value over time from wear and tear or because more modern, fuel-efficient vessels make them obsolete. It costs money even to take an underused ship out of service and park it somewhere. The waters off Falmouth in Britain and Elefsina in Greece are popular anchoring spots for idle ships.        ', u'\n                    Investment funds that specialize in buying distressed debt have been wary about putting money into ships.

She noted that some pensions had been disappointed.

', u'\n                    The changes at JPMorgan, which will go into effect by the end of May, will keep bank customers from racking up hundreds of dollars in fees, generated when the payday lenders repeatedly try to debit borrowers\u2019 accounts. Still, the changes will not prevent the payday lenders from extending high-cost credit to people living in the states where the loans are banned.        ', u'\n                    It is possible that other lenders could institute changes, especially because rivals have followed JPMorgan\u2019s lead in recent years. In 2009, for example, after JPMorgan capped overdraft fees at three a day, Wells Fargo also changed its policies to reduce the number of daily penalties charged.        ', u'\n                    The changes come as state and federal officials are zeroing in on how the banks enable online payday lenders to bypass state laws that ban the loans. By allowing the payday lenders to easily access customers\u2019 accounts, the authorities say the banks frustrate government efforts to protect borrowers from the loans, which some authorities have decried as predatory.        ', u'\n                    Both the ', u' and the ', u' are scrutinizing how the banks enable the lenders to dodge restrictions, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter. In New York, where JPMorgan has its headquarters, Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state\u2019s top banking regulator, is investigating the bank\u2019s role in enabling lenders to break state law, which caps interest rates on loans at 25 percent.        ', u'\n                    Facing restrictions across the country, payday lenders have migrated online and offshore. There is scant data about how many lenders have moved online, but as of 2011, the volume of online payday loans was $13 billion, up more than 120 percent from $5.8 billion in 2006, according to John Hecht, an analyst with the investment bank Stephens Inc.        ', u'\n                    By 2016, Mr. Hecht expects Internet loans to dominate the payday lending landscape, making up about 60 percent of the total payday loans extended.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan said that the bank will charge only one returned item fee per lender in a 30-day period when customers do not have enough money in their accounts to cover the withdrawals.        ', u'\n                    That shift is likely to help borrowers like Ivy Brodsky, 37, who was charged $1,523 in fees \u2014 a combination of insufficient funds, service fees and overdraft fees \u2014 in a single month after six Internet payday lenders tried to withdraw money from her account 55 times.        ', u'\n                    Another change at JPMorgan is intended to address the difficulty that payday loan customers face when they try to pay off their loans in full. Unless a customer contacts the online lender three days before the next withdrawal, the lender just rolls the loan over automatically, withdrawing solely the interest owed.        ', u'\n                    Even borrowers who contact lenders days ahead of time can find themselves lost in a dizzying Internet maze, according to consumer lawyers. Requests are not honored, callers reach voice recordings and the withdrawals continue, the lawyers say.        ', u'\n                    For borrowers, frustrated and harried, the banks are often the last hope to halt the debits. Although under federal law customers have the right to stop withdrawals, some borrowers say their banks do not honor their requests.        ', u'\n                    Polly Larimer, who lives in Richmond, Va., said she begged Bank of America last year to stop payday lenders from eroding what little money she had in her account. Ms. Larimer said that the bank did not honor her request for five months. In that time period, she was charged more than $1,300 in penalty fees, according to bank statements reviewed by The Times. Bank of America declined to comment.        ', u'\n                    To combat such problems, JPMorgan said the bank will provide training to their employees so that stop-payment requests are honored.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan will also make it much easier for customers to close their bank accounts. Until now, bank customers could not close their checking accounts unless all pending charges have been settled. The bank will now allow customers to close accounts if pending charges are deemed \u201cinappropriate.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some of the changes at JPMorgan Chase echo a bill introduced in July by Senator ', u', Democrat of Oregon, to further rein in payday lending.        ', u'\n                    A critical piece of that bill, pending in Congress, would enable borrowers to more easily halt the automatic withdrawals. The bill would also force lenders to abide by laws in the state where the borrower lives, rather than where the lender is.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan Chase said it is \u201cworking to proactively identify\u201d when lenders misuse automatic withdrawals. When the bank identifies those problems, it said, it will report errant lenders to the National Automated Clearing House Association, which oversees electronic withdrawals.

And because Wall Street is a place where magic works, the market will recognize this, giving each of the separated companies a higher price.        ', u'\n                    There is evidence of this effect. Studies of spinoffs ', u' that they produce short-term gains, although these gains evaporate over the long term.        ', u'\n                    Spinoffs, not surprisingly, are big business these days on Wall Street. Last year, there were 85 spinoffs worldwide worth $109 billion, according to Dealogic, down just a bit from 93 spinoffs worth $128 billion in 2011.        ', u'\n                    But spinoffs have a dark side, as they can serve as a convenient dumping ground. In 1999, ', u' spun off its auto parts maker into Delphi, and the following year, ', u' did the same with Visteon. Both automakers larded the subsidiaries with too much debt, high labor costs and sweetheart pricing deals. The result sent both spinoffs into bankruptcy. Ford and G.M. are still dealing with the fallout and litigation.        ', u'\n                    These deals show the temptation lurking in a spinoff: liabilities can be freely attached to the company being spun off. This is often management\u2019s best opportunity to burnish its own company at another\u2019s expense. It\u2019s hard to resist.        ', u'\n                    Take Tronox, the world\u2019s third-largest maker of pigment titanium dioxide, which was spun off from Kerr-McGee in 2006. It was given all of Kerr-McGee\u2019s environmental liabilities plus $200 million in debt, which it used to pay a pre-spinoff dividend to the parent. The company went bankrupt and is still litigating with Andarko, which later acquired Kerr-McGee, over allegations that the company had been sent off into the world without the resources to survive, let alone thrive.        ', u'\n                    Another example is Idearc\u2019s spinoff from ', u'. Before being set free, Idearc claims  that it took on $9 billion in debt to pay Verizon, also transferring some $2 billion in cash to Verizon. Idearc, a print and online directory business, soon went bankrupt. Idearc\u2019s bankruptcy trustee later sued Verizon, claiming that the spinoff was a convenient way to get rid of a business Verizon did not know what to do with.        ', u'\n                    The reason a spinoff is a preferred way to get rid of businesses a company no longer wants is that shareholders have no choice in the matter. The decision is simply made by the board.        ', u'\n                    The alternative is a sale of the company, but that requires someone to buy it. A spinoff is thus not only an alluring and convenient way to clean up the parent\u2019s balance sheet, it is also a way for managers to show faster earnings improvement by easily discarding a low- or no-growth business.        ', u'\n                    Another example is ', u'. Unable to sell the video rental company, its parent, ', u', spun it off, but before doing so arranged for the company to borrow $1 billion and pay a $905 million special dividend. Unfortunately, Blockbuster was spun off just as the industry began to experience big changes. With a bigger parent company, Blockbuster might have survived; but it was unable to cope and it, too, filed for bankruptcy.        ', u'\n                    Sometimes, businesses are spun off simply because they make no sense together. As a result, Frankenstein companies, random businesses stitched together, are created and sent out to the public markets without a clear strategy.        ', u'\n                    The ', u' spun off Vlasic Foods International in 1998 in order to focus on its higher margin and growth brands.

', u'\n                    This brings us to Time Warner.

The device costs $279 and includes a year of free online photo storage. It comes with 8 gigabytes of storage, enough to hold up to 6,000 photos. Its battery can last for a few days before it needs a recharge. The company has already received 3,000 orders, and it hopes to begin shipping devices by late April or early May.

', u'\n                    The disclosures this week add to the growing debate over compensation, as regulators look to rein in bankers\u2019 pay. On Friday, one labor union official in Britain criticized Barclays, calling the bank\u2019s payouts \u201cobscene.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Since the financial crisis, regulators and investors have been pushing banks to rethink their pay practices. While the banks have made some efforts in recent years, compensations levels remain persistently high, prompting regulators to take further action.        ', u'\n                    Last week, the ', u' proposed to cap bonuses at no more than the annual salary for the region\u2019s bankers. The British government has resisted such efforts, saying the move could prompt an exodus of talent and could have the \u201cperverse\u201d effect of raising fixed salaries.        ', u'\n                    But the region\u2019s banks cannot easily defend their outsize pay in the current environment. British institutions, already struggling to bolster profits since the crisis, have been tarnished by a series of scandals. In the latest disclosures on Friday, ', u', which is 82 percent owned by the British government after receiving a bailout during the financial crisis, announced on Friday that 93 of its employees earned more than more than \xa31 million, or $1.5 million, last year. The payments came even as R.B.S. reported a multibillion-pound loss last year. The bank did not disclose the similar figures of staff compensation for 2011.        ', u'\n                    Barclays, which came under fire after agreeing to a $450 million fine with American and British authorities related to the rate-rigging scandal, said in an annual report on Friday that 428 of its staff members still earned more than $1.5 million in 2012.        ', u'\n                    The British bank said the number of people earning more than that amount fell 10 percent compared with 2011. Barclays also paid five bankers more than $7.5 million each last year, down from 17 in 2011.        ', u'\n                    Another British bank, ', u', said on Monday that 204 members of its staff fell into the million-pound-or-more pay bracket, a 6 percent increase from the previous year. HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, also said on Monday that its net profit fell 17 percent last year because of a record fine to settle money-laundering charges and charges related to the value of its debt. HSBC settled charges that it transferred billions of dollars for nations under United States sanctions, enabled Mexican drug cartels to launder tainted money through the American financial system, and worked closely with Saudi Arabian banks linked to terrorist organizations.        ', u'\n                    The continued large payouts for some bank employees contrast with weak earnings at banks and a series of scandals connected to the manipulation of the ', u', or Libor, and money-laundering allegations.        ', u'\n                    Last year, Barclays reported a net loss of $1.5 billion, in contrast with a profit of $4.5 billion for 2011. The loss was driven by provisions to cover legal costs related to the rate-rigging scandal and other improper activities. The British bank has also announced a wide-ranging cost reduction program that includes cutting 3,700 jobs and closing some business units and branches.        ', u'\n                    Amid widespread criticism, financial institutions have been reining in pay, partly driven by a fall in earnings connected to the European debt crisis.

Barclays currently employs about 140,000.        ', u'\n                    As part of the overhaul, Barclays clawed back $450 million of deferred bonuses because of the bank\u2019s involvement in the scandals, which also led to the resignation of ', u' as its chief executive.        ', u'\n                    Barclays said it paid executive directors in total in 2012 less than half of what they received a year earlier. Mr. Jenkins bowed to public pressure and announced earlier that he would not take an annual bonus for 2012. His total remuneration was $3.9 million for last year, including $1.25 million in salary and $2.3 million as part of a long-term incentive plan.

', u'\n                    The ', u', released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve, indicate that most large banks would survive a severe recession and a crash in the markets. The tests, which measured a bank\u2019s capital levels during adverse conditions, help validate the government\u2019s efforts to shore up the financial systems.        ', u'\n                    But some analysts contend that the Fed was still too lenient with the banks. The stress tests, they argue, underestimate potential losses and the effects of several major financial firms collapsing, which can paralyze the entire system.

', u'\n                    With the industry\u2019s health improving, analysts predict that most big banks will now secure the Fed\u2019s blessing to return money to shareholders, including some unexpected candidates. ', u', for example, outperformed its rivals in the test just one year after a poor performance embarrassed the bank and thwarted its plans to distribute capital to shareholders.        ', u'\n                    This year, Citigroup did not wait long to celebrate. Minutes after the results were released, the bank announced that it asked the Fed\u2019s permission to carry out $1.2 billion in stock buybacks through the first quarter of 2014.        ', u'\n                    Other banks did not fare as well. ', u', which is majority-owned by the taxpayers since the crisis, burned through nearly all its buffer under the test, which assessed how much capital would remain at the end of 2014 once banks were subjected to hefty losses.        ', u'\n                    ', u' and ', u' also produced some of the lowest capital results among large Wall Street firms. ', u' would suffer $25 billion in trading losses under the test. The results were not unexpected; all three firms have significant trading operations that can rack up big losses in turbulent times.        ', u'\n                    The test results provided an important snapshot of the financial system more than four years after the banking industry was on the brink of collapse. Regulators hailed the industrywide improvements, underscoring what they portend for consumers and the economy.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe stress tests are a tool to gauge the resiliency of the financial sector,\u201d a Federal Reserve governor, Daniel K. Tarullo, said in a statement. \u201cSignificant increases in both the quality and quantity of bank capital,\u201d he said, helps \u201censure that banks can continue to lend to consumers and businesses, even in times of economic difficulty.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Investors will pore over the results, scanning for hints about how much money banks can return to shareholders. After the crisis, regulators prevented lenders like Citigroup and ', u' from increasing their dividends or repurchasing shares, forcing them instead to hoard capital to absorb losses.        ', u'\n                    Behind the scenes, the Fed will now signal to each bank whether it can proceed with new payout plans, potentially creating a tense face-off with regulators. If the Fed objects, a bank will have an opportunity to temper its proposals for dividend payments and share buybacks before the plans are released publicly next Thursday.        ', u'\n                    The stress tests have already caused tension between regulators and banks. The results, which reveal in some detail the losses that banks will suffer under times of stress, prompted wrangling with the Fed over how to conduct the tests and how much data to release.        ', u'\n                    In another sign of friction, the banks had to run the same test as the Fed \u2014 and in some cases produced rosier results. ', u' reported a projected 9.2 percent Tier 1 common ratio, the primary measure of financial strength tracked by regulators, by the end of 2014. That was far higher than the 7 percent calculated by the Fed.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America\u2019s outlook also trumped regulators\u2019 findings, while Citigroup\u2019s forecast hewed closely to the Fed. Those sorts of discrepancies may feed suspicions that financial firms are overly optimistic about their businesses.        ', u'\n                    In its overhaul of the regulatory system after the crisis, Congress mandated stress tests to provide an annual health check for the same banks that brought the economy to its knees. The Fed\u2019s tests take banks through a series of adverse conditions, not unlike the last crisis. The tests estimated that 18 banks sustain combined losses of $462 billion, in a period of considerable financial and economic stress in which unemployment soars, stock prices halve and house prices plummet more than 20 percent.        ', u'\n                    But, to some banking analysts, the tests did not fully capture some forces and events that occur during economic and market shocks. For instance, Wall Street firms may lose access to short-term loans critical to their survival. It is almost impossible to project the impact of the rapid collapse of one or two large financial firms, as in 2008, when ', u' and ', u' imploded.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Cole of DePaul said the projected losses on loans appeared too low for the severity of the imagined cases. \u201cIf we really had an economic crisis of this magnitude, the loss rates would be at least double on the real estate loans,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    The numbers also show that, over the last year, the Fed has cut its loss projections for certain types of loans. Last year, it projected a 9.5 percent loss rate on Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgages, but this year that dropped to 7.1 percent. The Fed declined to comment on specific banks, but a senior official said lower loss rates were the result of an improvement in the overall quality of the banks\u2019 loan portfolios.        ', u'\n                    Still, some analysts cheered the results, saying they confirmed the increasing optimism among investors. Bank stocks have risen sharply in recent months, gains that could continue on the heels of the stress tests.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s a very good exercise to do, showing everyone that the U.S. banking system is well capitalized,\u201d said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets.        ', u'\n                    In a surprise, Citigroup had a projected capital equivalent to 8.9 percent of its assets at the end of 2014, well above last year\u2019s showing. Bank of America\u2019s so-called Tier 1 common capital ratio registered at 6.9 percent, also an improvement.        ', u'\n                    But Morgan Stanley\u2019s ratio came in at 6.4 percent, temporarily restrained by its purchase of the remaining stake in the Smith Barney retail brokerage joint venture. JPMorgan\u2019s capital levels stood at 6.8 percent. While those banks\u2019 stress test results are lower than rivals, they are still strong capital numbers amid a crisis.        ', u'\n                    On one important alternative measure of capital, Goldman Sachs had a poor showing compared with its peers. Under the stressed case, the bank\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratio \u2014 another measure of capital strength that treats assets more conservatively \u2014 would fall to a low of 3.9 percent.        ', u'\n                    This could become an issue in any discussions between Goldman and the Fed about the bank\u2019s capital plan. When regulators assess whether a bank can proceed with its capital plan, the Tier 1 leverage ratio cannot fall below 3 percent. Goldman\u2019s own test showed the ratio falling to only 5.1 percent.        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The following week, investors find out whether those banks will be able to return more of their capital to shareholders by paying dividends or buying back stock.        ', u'\n                    Last year, the Fed passed most of the big banks and let them pay out billions. Bank of America, sensing a request would be unwelcome, didn\u2019t even ask. This year, however, Wall Street expects that Bank of America will get the green light.        ', u'\n                    Yet the bank continues to face gargantuan payouts to clean up legal disputes from the bubble years. Now a lawsuit suggests that the bank\u2019s mortgage portfolio could cost it tens of billions more than it had planned. In one big case, if things go wrong, Bank of America may be required to make good on many more billions worth of bad mortgages from ', u', which the bank acquired, in the sense that one acquires Ebola virus, in 2008.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America, however, has kept its legal reserves low \u2014 perhaps dangerously so.        ', u'\n                    The dispute involves a 2011 settlement that Bank of America reached with some of the world\u2019s biggest investors, including Pimco and ', u', for $8.5 billion. That amount covers more than $400 billion of Countrywide loans, on which there have been tens of billions of losses. The actual loss total is in dispute because they are estimates, but it ranges from $70 billion or so to well over $100 billion. That means, at the high end of the range, the settlement was for pennies on the dollar. On a conference call last week held by Mike Mayo, the CLSA bank analyst, a legal expert suggested that if things went south in the courts for Bank of America, the settlement might rise to $25 billion to $30 billion.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America contends that its reserves are reasonable, based on its estimated probable payouts. The bank wouldn\u2019t raise them \u201cbased on speculation from third-party observers who are not directly involved in any of these matters,\u201d a spokesman said.        ', u'\n                    Even in the fun house of litigation about mortgages, this one is particularly complicated. The dispute revolves around the question of whether another bank, BNY Mellon, working on behalf of mortgage-backed securities investors, was reasonable and acted in good faith in agreeing to the settlement. It is being hashed out in New York State Supreme Court. BNY Mellon is the trustee on 530 securitizations, or bundles of Countrywide mortgages, that were sold to investors.        ', u'\n                    The insurer ', u', along with some others, including the New York and Delaware attorneys general, are fighting about the settlement. ', u', the New York attorney general, has accused BNY Mellon of breaching its fiduciary duty. A BNY Mellon spokesman said, \u201cWe believe we have fulfilled all of our duties as trustee in this case.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The small settlement doesn\u2019t sit right. The group of investors who agreed to it hold only about a quarter of the securities, making it appear as if a minority has forced a bad deal on the majority in order to get few quick bucks and resolve any dispute. The Pimcos and BlackRocks of the world don\u2019t like to sue big banks. Things can get a little uncomfortable on the golf links. (They contend it was reasonable, given all the legal uncertainties of a protracted dispute.)        ', u'\n                    And who blessed the $8.5 billion figure anyway? To figure out whether it was fair, BNY Mellon relied on a firm called RRMS Advisors, a mortgage analysis firm.        ', u'\n                    The RRMS estimate has been in dispute for some time now. The firm relied on information from Bank of America, and critics contend it underestimated problems in the loans and the total losses. How BNY Mellon found little RRMS isn\u2019t clear; the bank wouldn\u2019t comment. RRMS\u2019s Brian Lin, who conducted the analysis, stood by his report, but declined to comment further.        ', u'\n                    Recently, other court rulings have boded ill for Bank of America. Judge ', u' of the Federal District Court in Manhattan has ruled that an insurer called ', u' was able to dispute mortgages that it backed and that were made by a small bank called Flagstar, without having to show that the contractual breach was the direct cause of the loss. In other words, the borrower may have defaulted, but Assured didn\u2019t have to demonstrate that it was because she didn\u2019t make $150,000 a year as a tarot card reader, as had been claimed on the borrower\u2019s loan application. If Bank of America is hit by such a ruling too, it might have to pay more. It argues its contracts are different.        ', u'\n                    So is Bank of America vulnerable? Not surprisingly, it is keeping whole swaths of expensive Manhattan law firms working all hours of the day to make the case that it isn\u2019t. BNY Mellon, too, contends it acted reasonably.        ', u'\n                    And the banks contend the $8.5 billion settlement is in line with other similar settlements. Of course, the investors continue to face huge hurdles even if rulings in this case start to go their way.        ', u'\n                    But even if the chances are low that the cases don\u2019t go in Bank of America\u2019s favor, an increase in legal reserves could be huge. So this is a low-probability, high-risk event. Another way of saying that is that it is a \u201cstress\u201d situation. And who just put banks through stress situations? Ah, right, the Federal Reserve.        ', u'\n                    The Fed, whose earlier decisions have been ', u', declined to comment for this column.        ', u'\n                    As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, authors of the new book, \u201cThe Banker\u2019s New Clothes,\u201d have argued, the big banks are undercapitalized and the simplest way for them to start building capital is to keep their profits instead of returning them to shareholders.        ', u'\n                    A look at Bank of America\u2019s estimates for how much it will have to pay for its mortgage liability is telling. It has gone up steadily each year. In 2009, the bank had a reserve of $3.5 billion. By last year, it had jumped to $19 billion, with an estimate of additional loss of up to another $4 billion.        ', u'\n                    And so Bank of America seems to have been consistently underestimating its legal exposure. (And it has other, undisclosed legal reserves for different cases. The incentives to lowball those are much greater, because the public cannot scrutinize them.)        ', u'\n                    In keeping the reserves low, Bank of America has already won. If it turns out that the bank loses its cases and has to pay much more money, it nevertheless has managed to make its books look that much better for years. That surely helped as it has tried to dig itself out of its financial crisis hole.

Anyone fit to shine a light on the darkest corners of Wall Street, S.E.C. officials say, must navigate its ins and outs. The arguments echo claims that ', u' picked the famed financier Joseph P.

Adding up the breakdown of the dividend payment that he outlined \u2014 $4.26 a share from existing cash, $1.73 from borrowing against receivables and $4.26 from new loans and bonds \u2014 yields $10.25, not $9.)

The deal requires the approval of a majority of independent shareholders, since Mr. Dell\u2019s stake of roughly 16 percent would not be counted.        ', u'\n                    That means at least 42.5 percent of Dell\u2019s shares must be voted in favor of the transaction. Complicating matters, abstentions count as no-votes.

And what truth will emerge?\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe arrival of the hedge fund billionaires \u2014 William A. Ackman, Daniel S. Loeb and ', u' \u2014 spawned a media circus. And at times, some investors acted as if they were the stars of a reality-TV show. Yet blustering and bluffing are what traders do, after all.        ', u'\n                    In the beginning, the dispute was over how Herbalife sold its products and to whom. In December, Mr. Ackman made a presentation at an investor conference, saying that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme. Herbalife vehemently denied those claims, and put on its own investor day in January to rebut them.        ', u'\n                    The focus, however, soon turned to the hedge fund celebrities. A day before Herbalife\u2019s presentation, Mr. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund, Third Point, ', u' 8.24 percent of the company\u2019s shares, giving Herbalife a huge show of support.        ', u'\n                    After Mr. Loeb, Mr. Icahn \u2014 who is worth some $15 billion, according to Forbes \u2014 entered the fray. Yet the fight first appeared to be about something other than Herbalife last month, when Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman duked it out on CNBC over real and imagined insults dating back a decade. At the time, Mr. Icahn did not disclose a position but noted that if someone tried to acquire Herbalife, it would spell trouble for Mr. Ackman because \u201cif that happens, that stock could rush to $100.\u201d        ', u'\n                    It was perhaps no surprise when Mr. Icahn ', u' that he had acquired an almost 13 percent interest in Herbalife. Mr. Icahn topped that off with an announcement last week that he had cut a deal to put two of his people on the Herbalife board and acquire as much as 25 percent of the company.        ', u'\n                    As a result, the debate over Herbalife has been reduced to the level of a junior high school feud as it becomes about traders trash-talking each other. Hedge fund billionaires may have huge egos and not like each other? Really? As Gordon Gekko says in the 1987 film \u201cWall Street,\u201d \u201cIf you need a friend, get a dog.\u201d        ', u'\n                    To employ another movie reference, what\u2019s happening with the hedge fund battle is the reverse of a famous \u201cGodfather\u201d quotation: It\u2019s not business, it\u2019s personal.        ', u'\n                    A recent exchange on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d program says it all. Under the heading \u201cThe Ackman Pain Trade,\u201d one of the hosts talked about why Mr. Ackman\u2019s claims were wrong. He stated, \u201cThe reason I think Herbalife is not a fraud is, No. 1, I have a very close personal relationship with Dan Loeb, who doesn\u2019t believe this is a fraud.\u201d Right.        ', u'\n                    So no one appears to be doing an actual investigation or asking the right questions. The central issue, in case you need reminding, is whether Herbalife is a pyramid scheme, in light of some of the questions that Mr. Ackman has raised. This is important, as not just billions are at stake, but an entire company and the tens of thousands of people who are affiliated with it.        ', u'\n                    And for all the talk of a \u201cshort war,\u201d the finance people are not likely to dictate the ending here. David Einhorn was reportedly short on Herbalife but has already closed his position. Mr. Loeb is said to have sold at least part of his stake at least, and may have sold it all. Mr. Loeb is required only to disclose the position in his quarterly reports to the ', u' in May. (Mr. Loeb declined to comment, and Mr. Einhorn did not respond to requests for comment made to his representative)        ', u'\n                    Hedge fund traders are in it for the short-term profit. And that\u2019s yet another reason the focus should be on the actual claims here instead of finance.        ', u'\n                    With the hedge fund titans exiting for a quick profit, the talk of a \u201cshort war\u201d will die down. But this still leaves Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman. It also leaves the specter of another financial trick, a short squeeze.        ', u'\n                    If a short squeeze occurs, Mr. Icahn\u2019s purchase of Herbalife shares, along with other purchases, will force Mr. Ackman to return the shares he had borrowed at a much higher price. This would be deadly \u2014 the 2008 short squeeze around Porsche\u2019s acquisition of ', u' sent VW\u2019s shares skyrocketing, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world. Mr. Ackman could lose more than a billion dollars if a similar situation were to happen at Herbalife.        ', u'\n                    But this is not likely to happen. Mr. Ackman probably didn\u2019t borrow his shares to short from hedge funds, but rather through ', u', his prime broker, using Herbalife shares held by index and other \u201csafe\u201d institutional investor funds like Fidelity. It is unlikely that these institutions will sell their shares or call them back. And shares available to short are likely to remain plentiful even after Mr. Icahn takes his full position.        ', u'\n                    Herbalife is not even among ', u', and about half of Mr. Ackman\u2019s position is traded every day on average, meaning that there is still a lot of stock out there.        ', u'\n                    So, it\u2019s unlikely that Mr. Ackman will be forced into a short squeeze without someone buying the entire company. Except for Mr. Icahn, it is hard to see anyone making a bid, given the uncertainty and the unwillingness of a bank to finance an offer. Certainly, a ', u' firm would not want to take the risk.        ', u'\n                    As for Mr. Icahn, he is taking two board seats and apparently entering into an agreement that he won\u2019t sell his shares for a year unless the price is above $73 a share. And Mr. Icahn has signed a standstill, agreeing not to make a bid unless someone else goes first.        ', u'\n                    So how will this end? It\u2019s not likely to end soon. Neither Mr. Ackman nor Mr. Icahn is going anywhere, and the rest of the hedge funds are just trading in and out, riding the waves. And while Mr. Ackman is hoping that regulators will step in and end it all, it is hard to see them acting without a very thorough and lengthy investigation.        ', u'\n                    And while Wall Street\u2019s focus, and everyone else\u2019s for that matter, has turned to the drama of two financiers who don\u2019t like each other (what\u2019s new?), it ignores what actually matters. In the absence of anyone looking at the facts, Herbalife will be under great pressure to keep its earnings up while Mr. Ackman continues to push the company to change how it reports those earnings.        ', u'\n                    Without someone buying the company, it is essentially a stalemate. The only way out appears to be over time as each quarter unfolds and Herbalife\u2019s model holds up under Mr. Ackman\u2019s scrutiny \u2014 or doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s face it, without something to stop the attacks, the company is going to undergo strain as time goes on and the questions and suspicions persist. But this could take years.        ', u'\n                    In other words, take a seat, folks, as this \u201cshort war\u201d may take something that Wall Street hates almost as much as it likes a good cat fight: patience.

Flint, HSBC\u2019s chairman, said in a statement that last year was \u201ca difficult one for all at HSBC as we addressed the restructuring of the firm against a lower-growth economic backdrop and with legacy issues and regulatory challenges imposing a further set of imperatives.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Gulliver added that he expected the market environment to remain \u201cdifficult,\u201d but that HSBC would benefit from growth of the economies in China and the United States even if European markets continued to struggle.

The bank sold its stake in Ping An Insurance of China for $9.4 billion and sold its credit card unit in the United States to ', u' for $2.6 billion. HSBC also sold its unit in Panama to ', u' for $2.1 billion last month.

', u'\n                    A failure by Mr. Osborne to win concessions during a monthly meeting here on Tuesday of the European Union\u2019s 27 finance ministers could fuel disenchantment with the Union among restive members of Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative party. Prime Minister David Cameron has already called for a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the Union.        ', u'\n                    Yet if Mr. Osborne pushes too hard against the bonus cap, his government risks criticism at home for succoring bankers. They are unpopular with large swaths of the British electorate for earning lavish salaries even as a prolonged economic downturn forces many households to scrimp. Many voters also resent the banking industry for receiving a series of giant bailouts paid for by taxpayers.        ', u'\n                    The meeting Tuesday will follow a Monday evening session by 17 of the same finance ministers, representatives of the euro currency union, who discussed but deferred action on a bailout request by Cyprus. That country is seeking about \u20ac17 billion, $22 billion, to shore up government finances and its banks, which were badly exposed to a debt write-down in Greece.        ', u'\n                    But for Britain, which is not a member of the euro zone, the banker bonus proposal is the main issue. The Cameron government considers the bonus cap \u201cmisguided and fear it could impact negatively on London without even combating the excessive risk-taking it was meant to address,\u201d said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a research organization based in London.        ', u'\n                    \u201cBut London is caught between a rock and a hard place, as there\u2019s much popular antipathy toward the bankers,\u201d Mr. Tilford said. The issue of banker remuneration \u201cis pretty toxic stuff Britain,\u201d he added.        ', u'\n                    Further undermining Britain\u2019s position ahead of the meeting is the result of a referendum over the weekend in Switzerland, also known for its business-friendly climate but where voters approved tighter restrictions on ', u'. That vote will give shareholders of companies listed in Switzerland a binding say on the overall pay packages for executives and directors.        ', u'\n                    The bonus cap legislation that concerns the British leadership cleared an important hurdle last week when representatives of E.U. governments and the European Parliament agreed that the coveted bonuses many bankers receive would be capped at no more than their annual salaries, starting next year. Only if a bank\u2019s shareholders approved could a bonus be higher \u2014 and even then it would be limited to no more than double the salary.        ', u'\n                    The rules are drafted so that a banker working in New York for a British bank like Barclays would be subject to the rules, as would a banker in London working for a U.S. bank like Citigroup.        ', u'\n                    Another reason Mr. Osborne may be hesitant to oppose the bonus rules too vociferously is that they are part of a legislative package that includes something his government favors: tougher rules about how much capital European banks most hold in reserve to protect against losses.        ', u'\n                    Britain and Mr. Osborne have strongly backed the higher capital requirements as essential for preventing another financial crisis.        ', u'\n                    In any event, European Union diplomats said ministers were unlikely to formally approve the rules on Tuesday because details still needed to be nailed down. That could still give Britain weeks, or even months, to press for concessions.        ', u'\n                    There are also questions among some European countries about how strictly to apply parts of the legislation requiring banks to publish detailed information on profits, taxes and subsidies on a country-by-country basis across the globe.        ', u'\n                    In the case of the separate Cyprus bailout discussions Monday evening, euro zone finance ministers were taking up talks that stalled with the country\u2019s previous, Communist-led government. That government was replaced late last month by a center-right administration, a change that has been welcomed in other European capitals.        ', u'\n                    Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who is the president of the so-called Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said Monday evening in Brussels after the group\u2019s meeting that political approval for a Cypriot bailout could happen during the second half of March.        ', u'\n                    He said an agreement had been reached with the Cypriots after face-to-face talks with the country\u2019s new finance minister, Michalis Sarris, on an independent review of how Cypriot banks are implementing anti-money laundering laws. But Mr. Dijsselbloem also declined to rule out forcing depositors in Cypriot banks to share in any losses, a move that is opposed by the new government in Nicosia.        ', u'\n                    There is a danger of a standoff between Cyprus and the so-called troika of foreign lenders \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank \u2014 over the terms of any deal. One concern for the I.M.F. may be whether Cyprus would ever be able to pay back loans that would be approximately equal to its entire gross domestic product.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI don\u2019t think that they are refusing in principle to participate,\u201d Michael Noonan, the finance minister of Ireland, said Monday about the I.M.F.\u2019s readiness to help Cyprus. \u201cI think they\u2019re indicating that the conditions are not yet in place for the board of the I.M.F. to take a decision to participate.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Another obstacle is that prominent lawmakers in Germany and other euro zone countries suspect that Cyprus has become haven for laundering Russian wealth. Meanwhile, the leadership of the newly elected Cypriot government is extremely wary of demands to remedy those and other problems.        ', u'\n                    Over the weekend Mr. Sarris, the Cypriot finance minister, warned against forcing depositors to take losses, rushing headlong into privatizations or taking an overly aggressive approach to combating money laundering \u2014 all of which, he said, could worsen the country\u2019s fragile economy.

', u'\n                    Because a large majority of the executives involved in the trade have since departed the bank, the hearing could increase scrutiny of Mr. Braunstein and Mr. Dimon, the remaining senior executives.

For example, he cites location data from cellphones and evermore consumption data as people increasingly use credit cards for even the smallest purchases. He distinguishes this behavioral data from less-telling data \u2014 about people\u2019s beliefs like Facebook communications or Google searches.        ', u'\n                    The fine-grained behavioral data, according to Mr. Pentland, opens the way to changing how we think about society and how a society is governed. Adam Smith and Karl Marx, he explains, thought about markets and classes, respectively. \u201cBut those are aggregates,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re averages.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Yet now, Mr. Pentland says, it becomes possible to track social phenomena down to the individual level and the social and economic connections among individuals.

', u'\n                    Instead, a data-driven approach to solar-energy incentives would concentrate government incentives to where the payoff is greatest in terms of efficiently generating alternative energy \u2014 larger buildings with a lot of roof space instead of small houses, Mr. Hundt said. A by-the-data model for benefits programs, he added, would suggest means-testing Social Security payments as well as adjusting payments locally for differences in costs of living.

', u'\n                    Intriguing, and perhaps wise policy, but it would also seem to be a redefinition of fairness as it applies to broad benefit programs, like Social Security and Medicare, which typically make standard payments and avoid means testing.        ', u'\n                    What are the chances such a data-driven course would be politically acceptable? If the data points the way to greater efficiency, why not, Mr. Hundt replied. After all, he said, a major role of government is to transfer income to people who would benefit most \u2014 better data, closely analyzed, means government can perform that role more effectively, Mr. Hundt said.

', u'\n                    It would be great if we could find an alternative investment like this, but what we\u2019re really talking about is finding an alternative to the basic idea of taking a risk to generate a return. The trouble is that risk and expected return are still \u2014 and will always be \u2014 closely related.        ', u'\n                    Take, for instance, stock mutual funds, which come with the risk that the value of your investment will go up or down a lot in the short term. The reward comes over the long term, with the higher returns historically associated with owning stock versus other types of investments.        ', u'\n                    Now there are other \u201csafer\u201d investments that don\u2019t come with as much risk, but offer a smaller reward, like bank C.D.\u2019s. It\u2019s common to see alternative investments pitched as comparable to these safe investments, but the numbers tell a different story.        ', u'\n                    The current average one-year C.D. nationwide pays 0.6 percent, and a five-year Treasury bill yields 0.78 percent. Those returns should give you a benchmark for the return on a relatively low-risk investment.        ', u'\n                    So when someone comes to you offering an investment that\u2019s \u201cjust like a C.D.,\u201d but it pays 7 percent, guess what: This investment is NOT just like a C.D. If it was just like a C.D., it would pay you what you expect a C.D. to yield.        ', u'\n                    Yes, we\u2019re in a terrible, tight spot. But the answer isn\u2019t to hope that a dubious, new product someone sells you will solve your problem. The odds are high it will only make things worse.

', u'\n                    The retrenching of the Nook unit represents a setback to the Barnes & Noble plan to build up its device business as a way of staying competitive in the rapidly changing e-book market.

', u'\n                    The results announced Thursday underscored the challenges. The company said that Nook revenue declined to $316 million for the quarter that ended Jan. 26, from $426 million over the same period a year ago. Losses in the unit increased to $190 million, from $83 million last year, as measured before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.        ', u'\n                    Over all, the company had a net loss in the quarter of just over $6 million, compared with net income of $52 million a year ago. Revenue in all three major units \u2014 Nook, retail and college \u2014 was down.        ', u'\n                    The losses were largely because of lower-than-anticipated sales, inventory charges and higher operating expenses because of advertising costs, the company said.

', u'\n                    In the call with analysts, Mr. Lynch was pressed on whether Barnes & Noble\u2019s digital content was really proprietary. Mr. Lynch acknowledged that what the bookseller possessed was the ability to sell publishers\u2019 content, but he insisted that it was \u201ca strategic asset that is hard to replicate.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Wall Street seemed heartened by the company\u2019s acknowledgment that it needed to recalibrate its device business, perhaps anticipating that it would accelerate a breakup of the device and retail units. Shares of Barnes & Noble rose 3.35 percent, to close at $15.74.

Mr. Lynch said Barnes & Noble continued to take market share from other physical book retailers. The company also promoted prototypes for new stores to be opened in malls and the growth of the college bookstore business.

', u'\n                    That notion got some support with the earnings report. Retail sales fell just more than 10 percent in the quarter, largely because of the closing of some unprofitable stores. But Barnes & Noble had largely anticipated the lower revenue and despite the sales decline, retail profits increased 7.3 percent, to $212 million, in part because of higher sales margins and \u201cexpense management,\u201d the company said.

', u'\n                    Bertelsmann said it would buy the 51 percent of BMG that it did not own from its partner in the venture, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The companies did not disclose financial terms, but a person with direct knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the purchase price was $700 million to $800 million, including the assumption of debt.        ', u'\n                    The deal signals a full return to the music business for Bertelsmann, whose other media properties include Random House and the magazine publisher Gruner & Jahr. After building the first incarnation of BMG, which stood for Bertelsmann Music Group, into a global powerhouse in the 1980s and \u201990s, Bertelsmann sold most of its music holdings through a series of deals with Sony and Universal in the mid-2000s.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe are bringing the music home to our group,\u201d Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.        ', u'\n                    BMG was revived in 2008, and the next year, K.K.R. made the first of its $270 million of investments in the company. BMG has made a string of acquisitions in music publishing, the side of the business that deals with copyrights for songwriting, and built a catalog of more than one million songs by artists like Johnny Cash, Carly Simon and Frank Ocean and Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe saw that music was going to make a comeback,\u201d Philipp Freise, a K.K.R. partner who directs its European media business, said in an interview. \u201cEverybody said music was going to die, but we said music will not die \u2014 it will grow.\u201d        ', u'\n                    K.K.R.\u2019s exit after four years was not unusual for it as an investor. But some analysts said they believed that the sale could have been precipitated by BMG\u2019s losing out on some of the biggest music auctions of the last couple of years, including Warner Music, EMI and, most recently, the Parlophone Label Group, a part of EMI that it divested itself of. (BMG has also bought some recorded music assets.)        ', u'\n                    Stressing efficient administration and the licensing opportunities of a largely digital business, BMG has been a bright spot for Bertelsmann.

Unlike many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, he never seemed to dream about building a huge company or even becoming fantastically wealthy. Groupon was an outgrowth of a start-up, the Point, which was aimed at encouraging charitable actions by groups. In late 2008, Mr. Mason and a few colleagues reformulated it as a deals shop.        ', u'\n                    Over the years, Silicon Valley start-ups had tried many forms of deal sites, but Groupon was the first to really make it work, and did so instantly. The formula was simple and compelling. People were sent e-mails of offers for, say, a local restaurant. If they bought it, they got a bargain, Groupon got a commission and the restaurant won new patrons.        ', u'\n                    In two years, Mr. Mason was turning down a reported $6 billion offer from Google.

To these losers, he then added a cover that featured Groupon.

It was the most talked-about tech debut between Google and Facebook. The actors, stand-up comics and other creative types who made up much of Groupon\u2019s early team watched in wonder.
