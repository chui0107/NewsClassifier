[([u'DEALBOOK; Chase Vote May Hinge On Director'], [u'\n                    In his 12 years as chief executive of ', u', Lee R. Raymond had a reputation for bulldozing analysts and long-winded shareholders and going toe-to-toe with government authorities. \n        ', u'\n                    \nNow as the lead director on the board of ', u', a crucial shareholder vote on splitting ', u'\u2019s jobs as chief executive and chairman could hinge on whether the 74-year-old Mr. Raymond is seen as strong enough to stand up to Mr. Dimon.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Raymond was well known for his ferocity as chief of Exxon Mobil, unafraid to cut off gadflies in midsentence during investor meetings.        ', u'\n                    \u201cHe is formidable,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, managing director of oil and gas research for ', u'. \u201cHe was never bashful to tell you just how wrong you were.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Yet a year after the bank posted a multibillion-dollar trading loss that has helped drive out top lieutenants, spurred federal inquiries and prompted Congressional hearings, a growing number of investors are questioning  whether Mr. Raymond has done enough to fortify risk controls and root out problems, say some of JPMorgan\u2019s biggest shareholders.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI am really surprised that there has not been more blood spilled in the boardroom,\u201d Mr. Gheit said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally alien to the Lee Raymond I know.\u201d        ', u'\n                    For some investors, the nonbinding vote, the result of which will be announced on May 21, is about good governance, not personalities.        ', u'\n                    \u201cYou have a complex, risk-laden financial institution. Jamie should run the business and someone else should run the board,\u201d said Michael Garland, executive director for corporate governance in the New York City comptroller\u2019s office. \u201cThe board needs to take aggressive action to demonstrate to regulators and shareholders that it is exercising strong independent oversight.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But other shareholders say they are taking a close look at Mr. Raymond and his role at JPMorgan, saying they need to figure out whether he has been an effective counterbalance to Mr. Dimon. If not, they said, they will probably vote to split the roles and push the board to find a chairman.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Raymond did not respond to requests for comment.        ', u'\n                    He has his defenders, who say he is a strong leader and a driving force behind decisions to claw back millions of dollars in compensation from executives at the center of the botched trades.

Warner III, who led J.P. Morgan & Company when it agreed to be acquired by Chase Manhattan for $30.9 billion in 2000, praised Mr. Raymond\u2019s leadership as a J.P. Morgan director during that merger.        ', u'\n                    \u201cKeep in mind, J.P. Morgan had not been in a merger since 1959, and it was a big and important decision,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an e-mail statement. \u201cLee led the board and management through the deal, that provided very good value for shareholders, short-term and long-term.\u201d        ', u'\n                    That company merged with Bank One in 2004 to form the current banking company.        ', u'\n                    The vote on whether to separate the chairman and chief executive roles is sure to be close. While Mr. Dimon has been careful not to tip his hand as to his plans in recent meetings with shareholders, according to various attendees who spoke on the condition of anonymity, investors are factoring in the possibility that Mr. Dimon may resign if they vote to split the roles.        ', u'\n                    A few major shareholders could swing the vote either way. In 2012, 40 percent of shareholders supported splitting the positions. In recent weeks, two shareholder advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services, or I.S.S., and Glass, Lewis & Company, have urged investors to vote for the split.        ', u'\n                    During a recent call with Mr. Raymond, Martha Carter, global head of research for I.S.S., said she raised concerns that three directors on the board\u2019s risk policy committee \u2014 David M. Cote, James S. Crown  and Ellen V. Futter  \u2014 lacked strong risk management backgrounds.        ', u'\n                    Ms. Carter said she also pressed Mr. Raymond to explain why the board had not gleaned risk-management lessons from Wall Street rivals like ', u' and ', u', which overhauled risk controls after recent trading mishaps.        ', u'\n                    While the three directors had served on the risk committee when JPMorgan navigated through the financial crisis, Ms. Carter said she asked Mr. Raymond to explain why the three board members had not been replaced by others with more experience. Mr. Raymond told her that it was a challenge to find qualified board members.        ', u'\n                    And instead of shaking up the risk committee, Mr. Raymond and other directors renewed their support for the board members. This month, for example, the board urged Ms. Futter to recommit to staying on the committee, according to two people briefed on the matter.

The report, issued on Monday, said that in the first quarter of the year, Apple took 57 percent of profit in the handset business, while Samsung took 43 percent.

The reason: Samsung makes so many different models of phones, and many customers are being lured to its Galaxy phones, which have bigger screens than all of Apple\u2019s iPhones. That\u2019s where Apple missed the boat, he said.

Loeb and John Paulson, the politicians Nicolas Sarkozy and Leon Panetta, and the entertainers Oliver Stone and Al Pacino.

On a single day, for example, JPMorgan filed 469 lawsuits, court records show.        ', u'\n                    As the bank plowed through the lawsuits, Ms. Harris said, JPMorgan took shortcuts like relying on court documents that were not reviewed for accuracy. \u201cTo maintain this breakneck pace,\u201d according to the lawsuit, JPMorgan relied on \u201cunlawful practices.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The accusations outlined in the lawsuit echo problems \u2014 from questionable documents used in lawsuits to incomplete records \u2014 that plagued the foreclosure process and prompted a multibillion-dollar settlement with big banks. One hallmark of the foreclosure crisis, robosigning, in which banks worked through mountains of legal documents without reviewing them for accuracy, is at the center of Ms. Harris\u2019s lawsuit against JPMorgan.

The ', u', one of the bank\u2019s chief regulators, is preparing an enforcement action against the bank over the way it collects its credit card debt, according to several people close to the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the cases publicly.

The bank, though, has been cooperating with regulators, including the California attorney general\u2019s office, to root out problems with its debt collection lawsuits, according to people briefed on the situation. Amid concerns that some of the underlying documentation was flawed, JPMorgan stopped filing new credit card lawsuits in 2011, these people said. In courts across the country, according to judges, JPMorgan has also been throwing out some pending lawsuits as well.

Still, lenders are working to clean up their books and whittle down the amount of soured loans, the judges say.        ', u'\n                    In most instances, the customers admit that they owe the money. The problem, though, judges and law enforcement officials say, is that credit card companies sometimes flout proper legal procedures to recover what they are owed. Many of the cases, according to Mr. Dear, the civil court judge in Brooklyn, hinge on erroneous documents, hastily assembled to make up for the fact that lenders have lost the original paperwork needed, like payment histories or the original contract. Some lawsuits rely on fabricated credit card statements, Mr. Dear said.        ', u'\n                    Lenders have been buffeted by this kind of criticism before over the way they pursued homeowners who had fallen behind on their mortgage payments. Last year, five of the nation\u2019s largest banks reached a $26 billion pact with 49 state attorneys general over claims the lenders wrongfully seized homes.        ', u'\n                    Now the regulatory spotlight is swinging from mortgages to credit cards. The problems in credit card lawsuits play out in the shadows, judges say. That is because unlike in foreclosure cases, borrowers sued over credit card debt rarely show up to defend themselves. As a result, more than 95 percent of lawsuits result in a default judgment, an automatic victory for the lender.        ', u'\n                    Armed with a default judgment, lenders can garnish a consumer\u2019s wages or freeze bank accounts to get their money back.        ', u'\n                    Sometimes borrowers do not even realize that they have been sued until a lender wins a default judgment, consumer lawyers say. The situation arises, consumer lawyers say, when lenders claim to serve borrowers with notice of a suit, as they are required to do under the law, but do not follow through. The practice, called \u201csewer service,\u201d is rampant across the country, the consumer lawyers say. Ms. Harris accused JPMorgan of sewer service in her lawsuit.

', u'\n                    Ms. Caro, who fell behind on her credit cards after multiple sclerosis forced her to stop working, said that she was shocked. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said.

Falcone last summer, they claimed his actions \u201cread like the final exam in a graduate school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully.\u201d        ', u'\n                    By Thursday, the agency appeared to be softening its tone.        ', u'\n                    Nearly a year after the', u' of manipulating the market, using hedge fund assets to pay his own taxes and \u201csecretly\u201d favoring select customers at the expense of others, Mr. Falcone disclosed in a public filing that he had \u201creached an agreement in principle\u201d to settle the two cases with the agency. The S.E.C. also struck a deal with Harbinger Capital Partners, Mr. Falcone\u2019s flagship hedge fund.        ', u'\n                    The settlement, which came after a federal judge in New York questioned aspects of the cases, would be a moral victory of sorts for Mr. Falcone, who has stubbornly resisted a deal for more than a year. It might also reignite concerns that the S.E.C.\u2019s results sometimes fall short of its ambitions.        ', u'\n                    The S.E.C.\u2019s punishment of Mr. Falcone appeared steep, if only because it spelled an end to his long career as a hedge fund wizard. Mr. Falcone, who made a fortune betting against the subprime mortgage market in 2007, has agreed to at least a two-year ban from raising new capital, a death knell for a hedge fund manager. He must also \u201ctake all actions reasonably necessary to expeditiously\u201d return money to investors who are fleeing the fund, according to the public filing on Thursday.        ', u'\n                    But with the exodus of capital, and a wireless venture that he bankrolled in bankruptcy, Mr. Falcone\u2019s hedge fund was already resigned to its fate. And the fine print of the S.E.C. deal suggests that Mr. Falcone, who is not required to admit or deny the agency\u2019s accusations, could escape relatively unscathed.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe settlement, itself, would change very little in Falcone\u2019s life,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and of business at the University of Michigan.        ', u'\n                    For one, the deal comes with an $18 million penalty from the S.E.C. \u2014 a rounding error to a hedge fund billionaire. Mr. Falcone will personally pay $4 million of the penalty, according to people briefed on the matter, while the fund\u2019s management company will pay the rest. One of the people briefed on the matter noted that $18 million was higher than what Mr. Falcone initially offered to pay and was a substantial sum given that the hedge fund\u2019s investors did not suffer any financial harm.        ', u'\n                    Still, the two-year ban comes with a loophole. According to the people briefed on the matter, the ban does not apply to the nine investment advisers that Mr. Falcone runs through Harbinger Capital. The S.E.C. granted the carve-out, the people said, so Mr. Falcone could unwind the hedge fund without harming investors by selling off pieces at fire-sale prices.        ', u'\n                    More important, perhaps, Mr. Falcone can retain his control of the Harbinger Group, a publicly traded conglomerate that he uses to make a broad array of investments. In recent years, Mr. Falcone has started to emerge as something of a private equity investor, taking varied stakes in the insurance business and consumer goods industry, including the company that produces the George Foreman grill. That business remains largely unaffected by the S.E.C. deal.        ', u'\n                    The settlement, the people said, is also notable for something that it did not include: a common provision that prohibits defendants from committing future violations with fraudulent intent.        ', u'\n                    The lack of a so-called fraud injunction, an unusual victory for the target of an S.E.C. action, is a reminder of broader concerns about the toughness of the agency. During the tenure of Robert Khuzami, the former enforcement chief of the S.E.C. who filed major cases against Wall Street firms, the agency came under scrutiny for not leveling bigger fines. He notably butted heads with a federal judge in New York, Jed S. Rakoff, who in 2010 called the agency\u2019s $150 million settlement with Bank of America over lax public disclosures \u201chalf-baked justice at best.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Now that the S.E.C. is in transition under a new chairwoman, Mary Jo White, the agency is vowing once again to strike a hard line against financial fraud.        ', u'\n                    An S.E.C. spokesman declined to discuss the terms of the settlement with Mr. Falcone, given that approval of the agency\u2019s commissioners is still required. Mr. Falcone\u2019s lawyer, Matthew S. Dontzin, also declined to comment.        ', u'\n                    The settlement emerged after earlier attempts at a deal came up short. Mr. Falcone, the people briefed on the matter said, refused to settle last year as long as the S.E.C. insisted on applying an injunction against fraud, which would amount to something of a rebuke. In June, the S.E.C. held its ground, deciding to file its cases instead.        ', u'\n                    But then the S.E.C. received a warning sign from Judge Paul Crotty, who at a hearing in February declared that in one part of a case: \u201cI\u2019m having difficulty seeing exactly where the wrong occurred here.\u201d        ']), ([u'BUCKS; Beware Calls To Settle Debt'], [u'\n                    It may sound like a solution: You are mired in debt and a telemarketer calls, offering to help reduce the amount you owe, in exchange for a fee.\n        ', u'\n                    \nBut consumers should be very wary of such calls, said Claire Rosenzweig, president and chief executive of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. \u201cIf someone just willy-nilly calls you and says they can reduce your debt, just don\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.

', u'\n                    That\u2019s what is alleged to have occurred, in a case announced by the federal government on Tuesday. The government charged a debt settlement company with defrauding more than 1,200 people who were struggling with credit card debt.

', u'\n                    According to the indictment, the firm contacted consumers by phone as well as by mail and promised to reduce their debts, typically by 45 percent. The firm took thousands of dollars in fees from customers, telling them it had to set aside money in escrow while it negotiated with creditors.

', u'\n                    In recent days, according to officials briefed on the matter, Rust Consulting issued nearly 100,000 checks for less than the homeowners were owed. The mistake potentially cheated consumers out of millions of dollars they were owed under a deal reached between the government and the nation\u2019s biggest banks.        ', u'\n                    Federal regulators ordered Rust to fix its mistake. And in a statement, Rust said late Wednesday that it had \u201ccorrected the error and plans to mail supplemental checks to affected borrowers as soon as May 17.\u201d It attributed the mistake to a \u201cclerical error.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But the developments cast another harsh spotlight on Rust, which had been selected as the distributor of checks for the $3.6 billion settlement deal that regulators struck with the banks. The continued problems with Rust also raised questions about the government\u2019s oversight of the firm and the wisdom of hiring it in the first place.        ', u'\n                    What\u2019s more, some homeowners complain the problem is broader than Rust has acknowledged. Jennifer Lawson, whose husband is on active duty with the Navy, said she was stunned when she received a check on April 19 for $600. Under the terms of the settlement deal, Ms. Lawson expected thousands of dollars in compensation for her foreclosure.

', u'\n                    In the foreclosure settlement case, in which regulators accused 13 lenders of wrongful evictions and other abuses, Rust appeared to be the logical choice. In fact, when executives from some banks suggested a different consulting firm for the foreclosure settlement, regulators balked, according to people briefed on the matter. The regulators instead suggested that the banks hire Rust.        ', u'\n                    But problems emerged soon after the settlement was announced in January. The consulting firm, officials said, was initially slow to alert borrowers to expected payments. Then, the officials say, Rust delayed the checks for weeks as it struggled to gear up for the payments.        ', u'\n                    Once Rust issued the first round of checks in April, it failed to move money into the bank account used for the settlement. The decision prevented some homeowners from cashing their checks.        ', u'\n                    Rust played down the mistake at first, saying in a private e-mail to banks that the \u201cperceived issues\u201d with a handful of checks lack \u201cmerit,\u201d according to a copy of the e-mail reviewed by The New York Times.        ', u'\n                    But, in effect, the checks bounced. And after the incident, Rust lost significant credibility with the regulators, officials said.        ', u'\n                    More recently, homeowners have complained about clerical errors at Rust, problems like checks sent to the wrong addresses or issued to deceased borrowers.        ', u'\n                    Norma Gammon, 54, said she thought things could not get much worse after her home in Evansville, Ind., was sold at foreclosure auction in June. But then she started dealing with Rust. After contacting Rust at least six times to update her address, Ms. Gammon said, she learned that the firm had sent the check to her foreclosed property. To receive another payment, Ms. Gammon has to fill out a new form. But Rust says the form has been sent three times, apparently to the wrong address.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating that I just want to cry,\u201d she said.

Unlike the other banks involved in the settlement, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley\u2019s foreclosures were not subjected to a long independent assessment by outside auditors. As such, the banks agreed to pay some of its customers an extra sum.        ', u'\n                    But Rust, according to the officials briefed on the matter, failed to follow the payout plan.

Its larger rival, Institutional Shareholder Services, on Friday supported a split and recommended against voting for three directors. Both reports also raised questions about the independence and qualifications of several board members.

The agency is also investigating whether the lenders dupe retirees into signing up for the loans by disguising the soaring interest rates, the people said.        ', u'\n                    As the baby boomer generation heads toward retirement and a growing number of older Americans shoulder crippling debt burdens, the pension advance firms are aggressively courting military veterans, teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with a hard-to-resist pitch: convert tomorrow\u2019s pension income into hard cash.        ', u'\n                    Much like payday loans, which typically are aimed at lower-income borrowers, pension loans can aggravate the distress of the vulnerable elderly who already are grappling with dwindling savings.

To go after the military members, the lenders have to skirt a federal law that bars veterans from turning over pension payments to third parties. To sidestep the prohibition, the pension advance firms typically urge veterans to set up separate bank accounts controlled by the firms, where the pension checks are deposited before being sent to the lenders, according to a review of the firms\u2019 advertisements.

In the case of ', u', the ', u' union has one number, and ', u', the chief executive of both Chrysler and ', u', has another.\n        ', u'\n                    \nAlas, they are $6 billion apart.        ', u'\n                    Fiat and the union workers\u2019 health care trust are fighting over that yawning gulf in a court in Delaware, arguing over buyout arrangements struck in the depths of the financial crisis when Chrysler was arguably worthless. It\u2019s a lesson in how deals struck hastily in the heat of crisis can come back to haunt in unexpected ways.        ', u'\n                    In 2009, Steven Rattner and his team at the Treasury Department ably brokered what could only be described as a prayer. Chrysler would be thrown into bankruptcy. Afterward, Fiat would own 20 percent, the Treasury Department would get 10 percent, and the Canadian government, 2 percent. The remaining 68 percent of Chrysler was given to the union workers\u2019 health care trust, formed to pay out Chrysler health care benefits to retirees. In addition to a majority ownership of Chrysler, the trust was also given a $4.59 billion note from Chrysler to eliminate the company\u2019s obligation to provide any further health benefits to retirees.        ', u'\n                    The deal was viewed as a bargain for a federal government desperate to save the automaker. At the time, Chrysler was a loser that most thought could not be saved. There were no buyers other than Fiat. And so the government was happy to give Fiat control, even though the Italian company had only a 20 percent stake. For this, Fiat paid nothing, instead offering its expertise.        ', u'\n                    As for the health care trust, the Treasury Department used the bankruptcy process to jump it ahead in priority. In a normal bankruptcy, the trust would most likely have been left with nothing. Instead, the government arranged for the trust to receive more than it otherwise would and more than almost all of Chrysler\u2019s creditors. The reason was to ensure employee peace. The government could do this because it was the only lender in town, putting up $8.5 billion of taxpayer money in the bankruptcy alone.        ', u'\n                    If it succeeded with Chrysler, Fiat wanted a clear path to acquire all of the company. So, Fiat negotiated an option to acquire 40 percent of the interests held by the health care trust and all of the interests held by the government. Starting in July 2012, the Italian company was allowed to purchase up to 20 percent of these covered interests every six months. Fiat also negotiated a series of arrangements that allowed it to increase its stake by making improvements to Chrysler.        ', u'\n                    These deals, which were cut in dark times, are coming back to bite.        ', u'\n                    Chrysler has since recovered and is now profitable. In the gloomy European market, Fiat is struggling.        ', u'\n                    To save Fiat, Mr. Marchionne wants to put the two automakers together. In 2011, Fiat took a step in this direction by purchasing the stakes held by the United States and Canadian governments for $640 million.        ', u'\n                    Now, it\u2019s the turn of the U.A.W.\u2019s health care trust, known as the voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA. But with real money at stake this time, the parties are ready to fight Detroit-style.        ', u'\n                    Last fall, Fiat exercised its option to buy 3.3 percent of Chrysler from the trust. Fiat calculated the price from the option agreement, and came to $139.7 million, valuing all of Chrysler at about $4.2 billion.        ', u'\n                    VEBA protested, asserting that Fiat misread the agreement. According to the trust, Fiat\u2019s calculations have a number of flaws, which means that this purchase should be at least $342 million and perhaps more, valuing Chrysler at more than $10 billion.        ', u'\n                    That means there is a $6 billion difference in value arising from each side\u2019s interpretation of the agreement.        ', u'\n                    The parties are litigating this gap, and the future of Mr. Marchionne\u2019s vision for Chrysler hangs in the balance. If the Delaware court rules for Fiat, Mr. Marchionne will continue to build his stake in Chrysler with an eye toward a buyout of the company.        ', u'\n                    If the court finds for VEBA, however, Mr. Marchionne may halt his pursuit, unable to find the billions to pay the trust. Still, at a minimum, it would mean billions more for Chrysler\u2019s retirees.        ', u'\n                    There is some irony in the dispute, given that the goal of the options was to get a value of what Chrysler was worth and avoid disputes.        ', u'\n                    But there is a big hole in the language spelling out how the option price works. The health care trust is claiming that the value of Chrysler should be calculated without counting the $4.5 billion note issued to it by the company. Fiat disputes this because the note reduces the value of Chrysler by about $4.5 billion.        ', u'\n                    Why the lawyers didn\u2019t specifically address this in the contract is a mystery. Whatever the reason, the lawyers used a term that talked about \u201cdebt for borrowed money,\u201d and health care trust argues that the note wasn\u2019t for money and so should be excluded.        ', u'\n                    Perhaps we should call it a $4.5 billion drafting error.        ', u'\n                    At a hearing before the Delaware judge a few weeks ago, VEBA also adopted another strategy \u2014 stall. The health care trust threw up all sorts of problems with the purchase price calculation, and also said a trial was needed.        ', u'\n                    The strategy is simple. The longer the delay, the more likely that Mr. Marchionne will cave and come to the negotiating table, paying more money.        ', u'\n                    As for those legal arguments and the dispute over the purchase price language, they highlight how small details can prove to be very important. Billions of dollars now turn on a single phrase and other items the lawyers didn\u2019t define or include in the contract.        ', u'\n                    This is where the fate of Chrysler and the health care trust sit as they await guidance from the Delaware court.        ', u'\n                    VEBA is underfunded by billions of dollars. It needs the money. (Coincidentally, the 2009 arrangements capped the trust\u2019s profits from Chrysler at about $4.5 billion, turning the rest over to the government. The government sold that right in 2011 to Fiat for $75 million. So, the maximum profit the trust can get from its Chrysler stake is $4.5 billion).        ', u'\n                    The union and the trust know that Fiat wants to deal, but things may not be so rosy in the future. Both Chrysler and Fiat face pressure to bring on new models from competitors. And remember, this deal affects only 40 percent of the health care trust\u2019s share. The rest still needs to be bought out, and the trust doesn\u2019t have to sell. The trust will use this additional leverage to aim for that $4.5 billion, because anything else goes back to Fiat.        ', u'\n                    It is ripe territory for a deal \u2014 if only a price can be agreed upon.

Fisker has raised $1.1 billion in venture financing, the most for any clean-technology start-up, compared with $848 million for Solyndra, the solar-panel maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2011, according to the Cleantech Group, which tracks such investments.

', u'\n                    The episode on Sunday night, \u201cFor Immediate Release,\u201d opens with an investment banker hunkered over agency documents, in the midst of preliminary due diligence.        ', u'\n                    The banker proposes selling 400,000 shares to the public at $9 a share. Given Sterling Cooper\u2019s existing 1.5 million outstanding shares, that would have valued the agency at $17.1 million \u2014 or about $114.4 million in today\u2019s dollars.        ', u'\n                    In the episode, Sterling Cooper eventually improved its position, winning a higher proposed price of $11 a share. That would have valued the agency at $20.9 million, or $139.8 million today.        ', u'\n                    By May 1968, when the episode is set, seven ad agencies had held initial stock offerings, according to ', u'. Among them were Wells Rich Greene and Papert, Koenig, Lois.        ', u'\n                    Over all, 21 agencies went public from 1962 to 1973, according to ', u' by Andrew von Nordenflycht, a business professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia. Among them were major shops like Doyle Dane Bernbach and Ogilvy & Mather, the latter of which ', u' among its shareholders.

Services companies like ad agencies became hot commodities, playing off the allure of Madison Avenue and its mad admen.        ', u'\n                    The trough wasn\u2019t restricted to the big names. As the banker (whose name or firm affiliation is never identified) notes in the \u201cMad Men\u201d episode, there was precedent for small advertising agencies going public. ', u' on Feb. 13, 1968, detailed the I.P.O. of Adams Dana Silverstein, then the tiniest firm in the industry to begin trading publicly.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe made our decision to go public \u2014 a gutsy one \u2014 six months after we started and our reason was that we wanted to build a damn good agency and staff,\u201d D. W. Silverstein, the firm\u2019s president, told The Times then.        ', u'\n                    Yet the bubble eventually burst, violently. Of the 21 agencies that had held I.P.O.\u2019s, two failed and six had gone private by 1978, according to Professor von Nordenflycht.        ', u'\n                    Today, the advertising concerns that remain publicly traded are largely giant conglomerates like Omnicom and WPP, which own scores of smaller shops and have largely thrived. A number of small digital advertising firms went public in the late 1990s, only to sputter in the wake of the dot-com bust.        ', u'\n                    Why? Big firms can spread out their risks among a number of their holdings, making their earnings less volatile.        ', u'\n                    And then consider Sterling Cooper. News that Jaguar had left as a client prompted an apoplectic fit by the junior partner Pete Campbell, and with good reason: Don\u2019s summary firing of the car company took away a significant amount of revenue. It wasn\u2019t the first time the firm had suffered from a client departure; Lucky Strike\u2019s exit was chief among them. (At the end of the third season, the cigarette maker brought in $24 million in billings. Vicks Chemical, which was gone as of Sunday\u2019s episode, was worth $9 million.)        ', u'\n                    And as service businesses, ad agencies are at the mercy of client fees rolling in, a lumpy operating model that wins little favor among many investors. The same problem prompted investment banks like Lazard and Evercore Partners to add steady-revenue businesses like asset management for smoother earnings.        ', u'\n                    Adams Dana Silverstein\u2019s very reason for going public proves the point. The 1968 article noted that the idea came after the agency, founded two years earlier, had just lost its first account.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe were just sitting here,\u201d Bill Silverstein told The Times, \u201chaving just lost an account and had just staffed up. We didn\u2019t want to go backward. So we said, \u2018Why not go public?\u2019\xa0\u201d        ', u'\n                    As Professor von Nordenflycht notes, the ad industry of the time wasn\u2019t sitting on particularly notable growth or profitability during the early 1960s.        ', u'\n                    And the firms taking these agencies public weren\u2019t always of the highest caliber. Bert Cooper, a name partner, sniffs that the banker pitching Sterling Cooper \u2014 who was earlier shown furiously punching an adding machine \u2014 conducted only 20 minutes of analysis.        ', u'\n                    His dismissive reply to the banker\u2019s preliminary estimate hinted of the army of drones seeking business: \u201cI can\u2019t take this to the rest of partners, but I can take it to other underwriters.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Adams Dana Silverstein was taken public by the Hancock Securities Corporation, which was eventually expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers in 1972, according to ', u'.

His company, Teledyne, became a remarkably successful and huge conglomerate, with an assortment of related \u2014 and unrelated \u2014 businesses. Like Mr. Buffett, Mr. Singleton was a modest man with a rare sense of rationality. He didn\u2019t pay his shareholders dividends; he was convinced he could allocate the money more profitably. And he was right more often than not.        ', u'\n                    But after spending decades creating one of the world\u2019s largest conglomerates, Mr. Singleton, who stepped down as chief executive in 1986 but remained as chairman, decided to break it into three companies in the early 1990s before he ', u' in 1999. He decided that Teledyne had become too big and unwieldy for a single manager to effectively oversee and expand.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s a narrative that has been speculated about for years when it comes to Mr. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, the fifth largest company in the world, judged by market value.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Singleton\u2019s name was invoked by Douglas A. Kass, an investor who is betting against Berkshire\u2019s stock and was invited to the meeting to pepper Mr. Buffett with questions along with a panel of analysts and journalists, including this one.        ', u'\n                    After explaining the story of Mr. Singleton, whom Mr. Buffett long admired, Mr. Kass then asked: \u201cWhat is the advisability of restructuring Berkshire into separately traded companies organized along business lines?\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Buffett, who has described Berkshire as his \u201cpainting,\u201d paused briefly.

', u'\n                    \u201cBreaking them up into several companies I\u2019m convinced would create a poorer result,\u201d Mr. Buffett insisted, while praising Mr. Singleton as an investor. Charles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, had this to say about Mr. Singleton: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should get into your head, just because he is a genius, he did it better than us.\u201d (Mr. Munger knew Mr. Singleton personally.)

Maybe we have a better system.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The question, of course, is how much is \u201ca little better\u201d?

', u'\n                    Part of Mr. Buffett\u2019s bet is that Berkshire\u2019s value and advantage now lie in its size and scale. He believes that in flat or down markets, Berkshire will be able to outperform others because it can take advantage of opportunities \u2014 with its huge cash pile \u2014 that others cannot.

', u'\n                    Merrill Lynch was in a position to collect billions from the insurer \u2014 if it had enough cash to meet its obligations.        ', u'\n                    But it seemed unlikely that MBIA could come up with the cash unless Countrywide agreed to pay billions to settle claims that it had misled the insurer regarding the quality of mortgages in securitizations insured by MBIA, and had failed to honor its obligations to repurchase those mortgages.        ', u'\n                    Now the multibillion-dollar claims the institutions had against each other will be canceled out. Under the agreement, Bank of America will pay $1.6 billion in cash to MBIA, and will lend the firm another $500 million. It also acquired warrants that, if exercised, would give the bank a 4.9 percent stake in the insurer. In addition, the bank will surrender to MBIA about $130 million in MBIA bonds.

Bank of America shares surged 64 cents, or 5 percent, to $12.88.        ', u'\n                    Before the settlement, it appeared that within weeks the insurer would owe as much as $3 billion to Merrill Lynch stemming from credit-default swaps issued by MBIA concerning commercial real estate transactions.        ', u'\n                    MBIA Corporation had met earlier obligations by borrowing money from National, the municipal bond part of the company.        ', u'\n                    But Benjamin Lawsky, the New York State financial services superintendent, refused to allow further loans, and it was expected that MBIA Corporation might be put into receivership before it had to pay Merrill Lynch.        ', u'\n                    In an interview, Mr. Lawsky said negotiations had been going on for more than a year, but accelerated in the last couple of weeks. \u201cThere was a way to get to yes because everyone had claims on everyone else,\u201d he said. The agreement, he said \u201cresolves significant exposure and expensive litigation for Bank of America, while also giving MBIA a path forward.\u201d        ', u'\n                    MBIA originally insured municipal bonds, a profitable business because few such bonds ever defaulted and municipalities buying the insurance would get AAA ratings on their bonds, saving them more in interest payments than the insurance cost because many muni bond investors were very risk-averse.        ', u'\n                    It later expanded into insuring securitizations and writing credit-default swaps, businesses in which the purchasers were more sophisticated.

', u'\n                    In 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, which later was folded into the Department of Financial Services, approved a decision by MBIA to split into the two companies. Banks and hedge funds that owned securities insured by MBIA went to court to try to reverse the split. In March, MBIA prevailed in one of those suits, as Justice Barbara R. Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the insurance department had wide latitude to approve the split with or without much investigation.        ', u'\n                    She cited a deposition by Michael Moriarty, the then-deputy superintendent of the department, who said \u201cthe department did not, nor do they usually, verify the financial condition of a company.\u201d Since that was the policy, the judge concluded she had no authority to question it, even if some information provided by the company was false.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America had vowed to appeal that decision, raising the possibility that an appellate court would order a trial that could be embarrassing to the state regulator. Under the settlement, the bank will drop that appeal.        ', u'\n                    Some MBIA legal disputes remain. ', u', the French bank, remains a plaintiff in the suit over the split, and that dispute seems likely to cost MBIA perhaps $200 million to settle. MBIA is also pursuing complaints against ResCap, a mortgage company previously owned by ', u'\u2019 finance arm, and against ', u', the Swiss bank. Settlement of those disputes potentially could bring in more than $500 million to MBIA.        ', u'\n                    Another suit against the MBIA split was filed by hedge funds that feared their insurance claims would not be honored. That suit is still pending, but the agreement would make it harder to pursue since all the information the bank obtained in disclosure from MBIA would be returned to the insurer.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America had bought the bonds in an effort to frustrate MBIA\u2019s effort to change their terms. By turning over the bonds to the insurer, it now seems likely MBIA can change the terms. The expectation is that MBIA will eventually resell the bonds to investors, providing cash for the company.        ', u'\n                    The money provided by Bank of America will largely be used to repay the loans National made to MBIA Corporation, solidifying National\u2019s finances.

', u'\n                    After the deal was reached in February 2012, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office began receiving a deluge of complaints from housing counselors across the state.

', u'\n                    The note was ominous, he said: Mr. Farnsworth had 48 hours to resubmit many documents, including tax returns, or his loan modification would be scuttled. Under the mortgage settlement, though, Wells Fargo was required to notify Mr. Farnsworth about missing documents five days after he submitted a loan application and to then give him 30 days to submit any missing documentation.        ', u'\n                    Wells Fargo declined to comment on Mr. Farnsworth\u2019s case, citing customer privacy, but said that the bank \u201cis doing everything we can to assist customers so that they can stay in their homes if possible.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The servicing standards were intended in part to address delays that can torpedo efforts to save a home. Before the settlement, housing counselors said that homeowners were ensnared in a bureaucratic maze when seeking foreclosure relief. Some borrowers were asked for the same document multiple times, while others were shuttled from one representative to another. As their applications for relief languished, housing counselors said, borrowers accrued fresh costs, like late fees and property taxes, that aggravated their distress.

Since Wells Fargo began foreclosure proceedings against him in 2010, Mr. Nareen said he had tried to win a reduced monthly mortgage payment, but had been asked for documents numerous times.

The agreement still needs the approval of the bankruptcy court.

']), ([u'DEALBOOK; A New Fed Thought for \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Banks: Shrink Them'], [u'\n                    A nagging sense seems to pervade the public\u2019s mind that the nation\u2019s biggest banks still pose a risk to the wider economy, despite all that has been done since the 2008 financial crisis. \n        ', u'\n                    \nIt seems that disquiet persists even at the heart of the regulatory establishment. The latest call to action came on Friday from Daniel K. Tarullo, a governor at the Federal Reserve, an agency that plays a crucial role in shaping new banking rules.        ', u'\n                    In a speech before the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, he described a tough, new measure that could be squarely aimed at large Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Tarullo may have chosen an opportune time to make his case.        ', u'\n                    His speech comes amid increasing calls to do more to deal with the so-called too-big-to-fail issue. This holds that some financial institutions are so big that, if they were to collapse, they would damage the rest of the financial system, and weigh on the economy.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Tarullo said much had been done to make the financial system safer, through the two main overhauls that came after the crisis. Those are the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010, and the internationally agreed bank regulations known as Basel III. In particular, these initiatives have made banks hold more capital, a part of a bank\u2019s balance sheet that can serve as a buffer against losses. Before the crash of 2008, banks had insufficient capital, which stoked the fears that swept the global financial system. Taxpayers had to step in and provide new capital as part of efforts to restore confidence.        ', u'\n                    Still, Mr. Tarullo sees remaining areas of concern. He focused on the markets where Wall Street banks borrow huge sums of money for short periods. They use their borrowings in these so-called wholesale markets to then buy assets. But in times of stress, like 2008, these markets can dry up. Deprived of their lifeblood, banks rush to sell off the assets they bought with their wholesale borrowings, which can set off a wider collapse.        ', u'\n                    \u201cRelatively little has been done to change the structure of wholesale funding markets so as to make them less susceptible to damaging runs,\u201d he said in the speech.        ', u'\n                    To make the system safer, Mr. Tarullo floated an idea that could affect banks that make heavy use of wholesale markets. His idea is to require such banks to hold extra capital. How much extra would depend on how flush a bank\u2019s balance sheet is. Such a program is more aimed at the major Wall Street institutions, while leaving regional lenders and even large consumer-oriented banks like Wells Fargo largely unscathed.        ', u'\n                    Under the current rules, large banks have to hold a pool of assets they can theoretically sell quickly to cover any outflows that occur in a turbulent period in the markets. Under Mr. Tarullo\u2019s idea, the larger this pool, the less extra capital they would have to hold to cover the risk present in wholesale markets.        ', u'\n                    In reality, however, banks would probably do less wholesale borrowing to avoid the tougher capital requirements. In turn, that might prompt them to shrink their overall size, and therefore, not be so big as to require a government bailout if they failed.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe would do the American public a fundamental disservice were we to declare victory without tackling the structural weaknesses of short-term wholesale funding markets, both in general and as they affect the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 problem,\u201d Mr. Tarullo said.        ', u'\n                    The speech, which called for other changes to toughen regulation, follows a recently introduced bill that took aim at large banks.        ', u'\n                    The legislation, from Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, would subject the biggest banks to much higher capital requirements than smaller banks. If the bill is passed, many large banks would probably choose to divest themselves of assets to shrink to a size where they would not be required to hold higher amounts of capital.        ', u'\n                    The bill has already generated fierce objections from the financial industry. Its critics said the capital increases would force banks to cut back on their lending, and they argued that large banks provide unique benefits to the economy.        ', u'\n                    Political analysts have said that the Brown-Vitter bill has little chance of passing, but the measure has reignited a conversation about what to do about banks whose failure could weaken the broader financial system.        ', u'\n                    Regulators like the Federal Reserve, however, do not have to wait for Congress to pass legislation to introduce new measures. The Dodd-Frank Act gave regulators substantial freedom to impose measures to strengthen the system on their own.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Tarullo mentioned that leeway in this speech on Friday. The Fed could use that authority to push forward on the measure to raise capital requirements for firms that make big use of wholesale debt markets. And it could impose  another notable measure mentioned by Mr. Tarullo.        ', u'\n                    It involves something called the leverage ratio. This measures capital as a percentage of assets. It differs from other regulatory capital ratios in that it doesn\u2019t adjust the assets for their perceived riskiness. Some analysts say they believe the \u201crisk-based\u201d approach is flawed and can lead a bank to hold too little capital.        ', u'\n                    They say the leverage ratio is a safer measure of capital because it doesn\u2019t treat some assets as less risky than others. Mr. Tarullo said the Fed might set a higher leverage ratio.        ', u'\n                    Despite this call, some analysts said that Mr. Tarullo did not appear to be advocating for the much higher capital levels envisioned in the Brown-Vitter bill. The legislation requires banks with over $500 billion to have capital that is equivalent to 15 percent of their assets.        ', u'\n                    \u201cHe\u2019s definitely not calling for a 15 percent leverage ratio like Brown-Vitter,\u201d said Patrick Sims, a director at Hamilton Place Strategies, a policy firm that has aired objections to some of the contents in the senators\u2019 bill.

Since beginning his research, manager Mr. Kass has found a number of similarities with Mr. Buffett. For example, both have been treated for prostate cancer, and both once collected discarded horse-racing tickets at tracks in their younger days.

Mr. Buffett, 82, is likely to reiterate that his company \u2014 a huge conglomerate that counts railroads, private jets and running shoes among its holdings \u2014 has a succession plan in place for when he finally hangs up his investor\u2019s hat. (He\u2019s unlikely to say who will succeed him as chief executive.)        ', u'\n                    He will also most likely discuss his hunger to strike more big deals, one of his signature corporate moves. Neither of his acquisitions this year appears to qualify for the giant takeovers he craves: Berkshire teamed up with a Brazilian investment firm to buy ', u' for $23 billion, and it bought the 20 percent of the Israeli tool maker IMC that it did not already own for about $2 billion.

Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman.        ', u'\n                    He is also expected to discuss his recent newspaper buying spree, having bought 28 dailies over the last year and a half for $344 million. While the acquisition campaign is not the most expensive he has ever conducted, Mr. Buffett has described himself as an addict who sees value in local news.        ', u'\n                    It is unclear whether he will be asked about another new move: into social media. On Thursday at 11:20 a.m. Omaha time, Mr. Buffett overcame a famous aversion to technology by posting his first message on ', u'. \u201cWarren is in the house,\u201d he wrote as a camera for Fortune magazine hovered over his shoulder, capturing every tap.

Among them is Mr. Kass, a prolific user of Twitter who has been documenting his passage to Omaha.

', u'\n                    On Thursday, Mr. Cohen sought to convince SAC investors and regulators that he takes compliance seriously. In a letter to his investors, Mr. Cohen announced a broad set of changes that would bolster the fund\u2019s compliance practices, including clawing back the pay of employees who violate the law.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThese reforms send an unmistakable message: We have zero tolerance for wrongdoing and if you are caught breaking the rules, it will cost you,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote in the letter. \u201cThis problem is our problem to solve.

Last week, the firm extended a May 15 deadline for withdrawals for an additional three months.        ', u'\n                    Earlier this year, investors withdrew $1.7 billion, or about 25 percent of its outside money. (The rest of SAC\u2019s funds \u2014 about $9 billion \u2014 is mostly Mr. Cohen\u2019s.)        ', u'\n                    SAC is adopting these measures as federal prosecutors continue to press criminal cases against two former SAC employees \u2014 Mathew Martoma and Michael S. Steinberg \u2014 and the fund awaits final approval of a record $602 million civil settlement with securities regulators related to one of those cases.        ', u'\n                    All told, at least nine current or former SAC employees have been tied to insider trading while at the fund; four have pleaded guilty.

Some applauded the move, noting that it was a clear effort by Mr. Cohen, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, to take ownership of what many have perceived as a lax approach to compliance.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe S.E.C. is very focused on the tone at the top,\u201d said Steven B.

', u'\n                    \u201cWhy does SAC need to warn employees that they will hold back the pay of malefactors?\u201d said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisal. \u201cDo they need an inducement to not violate the law?\u201d        ', u'\n                    As described by Mr. Cohen, if an employee is accused of wrongdoing and leaves the fund, SAC will hold back any deferred compensation. If the employee is convicted or subject to other sanctions, that compensation will not be paid. Mr. Cohen compared the new clawback rule to those that the large banks instituted after the financial crisis under pressure from regulators.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe want to let job applicants know that if they do not intend to play by the rules they should not come to SAC,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.

The firm said that it had 10 people in the department five years ago. In addition, it instituted guidelines for how SAC employees interact with public company employees and use \u201cexpert network\u201d firms.

']), ([u"YOU'RE THE BOSS; Paid Sick Leave Irks Some Owners"], [u'\n                    When the advocates at ', u' sought to muster support among businesses in Portland for a local paid sick leave ordinance, they found a sympathetic ear in Tony Fuentes. Mr. Fuentes and his wife operate ', u', which sells cloth diapers and clothing for babies and children on Portland\u2019s northeast side.\n        ', u'\n                    \n\u201cThe idea that 80 percent of low-income workers don\u2019t get a minute of protected time was not in line with my view of the country, or of the social compact,\u201d Mr. Fuentes said, who testified in favor of the bill at a council hearing.        ', u'\n                    But to judge by the efforts of local business organizations in Portland and in New York City, which is ', u', as well as from interviews with a handful of businesses, the more common response is hostility, or at least wariness.        ', u'\n                    Portland\u2019s ', u', which passed the City Council in March, follows a ', u' set by a handful of other cities, and Connecticut, in the last seven years. (In Philadelphia, a similar proposal could not overcome a ', u' by the mayor.) Businesses with at least six employees have to provide one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours an employee works, up to 40 hours a year, as well as protect the employee\u2019s job. Companies with five or fewer employees must offer the same amount of unpaid, job-protected time off. An employee must work at least 240 hours before becoming eligible. In Portland, the law takes effect in January.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Fuentes said that he already offered paid time off to all of his employees (the number fluctuates between five and seven). They can use the time for any purpose, he said, and he has found that offering the time has added just 1 percent to his total labor expense. \u201cThe costs are pretty minimal,\u201d he said, \u201cand, talking with other businesses in Portland doing the same thing, our costs are line with theirs.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Because Mr. Fuentes has a paid time-off policy that is at least as generous as what the city will soon require for sick leave, he will not be affected by the new law. But whether a business owner supports the law does not necessarily turn on how much strain the law will put on the company. Family Forward Oregon also tried to press Lisa Schroeder, owner of ', u' into service for paid sick leave. Ms. Schroeder also offers paid time off and may have seemed a promising candidate to be a public face for the measure, since she is well known for her liberal views on other issues. But Ms. Schroeder demurred.

Ms. Kitchin provides paid time off for her three full-time workers, but not for her crew of part-timers, which this year has ranged from one to three \u2014 she said she wasn\u2019t sure whether the law would require her to offer paid leave. (Lisa Frack, spokeswoman for Family Forward Oregon, said that question would be resolved when the rules to carry out the law are written this summer.)        ', u'\n                    \u201cFor some of our people that we\u2019ve brought in part time, they might work 20 hours one week and four hours the next week,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our payroll software doesn\u2019t really track the benefits by cumulative hours. It tracks them by pay period, or by month, which adds to the cost.        ', u'\n                    \u201cBy itself, it\u2019s not the end of the world. But do you know how many other things there are like this? It\u2019s the cumulative effect of all these little things,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn my field, there are contractors who not only won\u2019t do this but don\u2019t even pay payroll taxes, liability insurance. They don\u2019t get licensing and bonding. So this is just one more burden to businesses that are trying to follow the rules.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Ms. Kitchin, who testified against the ordinance in a council hearing, said that next year, she might rely on a staffing agency or have her current employees work longer hours rather than hire additional part-timers, though she acknowledged that both of these alternatives would add to her costs as well.        ', u'\n                    For businesses like Ms. Kitchin\u2019s, the bill in New York City promises a somewhat lighter touch than the Portland ordinance.

If you walk in the hallways, recruiting kids, and they\u2019ve already heard from their peers that you love the heck out of your team and help to get the best out of them, word gets around. All it takes is a sincere reaching out.        ', u'\n                    I also recruited great coaches to be on my staff. It wasn\u2019t just me.

If you\u2019re going to build an organization \u2013 a sports team, a business, or any organization, you have to figure out how to get the team members to work hard. At Manassas, the kids knew that I was running my own business, and had a family and my own kids at home, but they saw me working hard every day, volunteering at the school to be their coach. The kids on the team knew that I cared about them and worked hard for them, and as a result, they worked hard for me.

Wells says it keeps all these loans at its broker-dealer, taking a higher capital charge. Bank of America keeps some at its broker-dealer and some in a unit that allows it to set aside less capital. An arbitration case in Tampa, Fla., has opened a window on the different choices that financial firms make about where to house virtually identical assets and how those decisions can reduce a firm\u2019s capital burden. Such calls \u2014 rarely disclosed publicly \u2014 have become more important since the financial crisis as regulators have pushed banks to hold more capital to protect against potential losses.

', u'\n                    Details about Morgan Stanley\u2019s arrangement emerged in a recent dispute involving a former financial adviser. The broker, James Eastman, 59, filed an arbitration claim against the bank after he left in 2010, arguing defamation of character and wrongful dismissal. He sought to have his loans from the bank forgiven, something Morgan Stanley was unwilling to do.        ', u'\n                    After working at Citigroup for years, Mr. Eastman became part of Morgan Stanley after the two firms combined their brokerage operations.        ', u'\n                    He ended up with two loans. The first was made in 2001, when he started at Citigroup, and it was valued at $942,532. It was forgivable over 10 years, and then subsequently extended. In 2009, he received another loan, valued at $214,648, to encourage him to stay through the merger. Mr. Eastman left the company in 2010, owing roughly $400,000 on the two loans, according to his lawyer, Chris Vernon.        ', u'\n                    Typically a broker gets a loan that covers several years and is required to pay interest on it. The broker repays the loan using earnings from a parallel bonus pool, assuming certain performance targets are met. If they are not, or the broker bolts to another firm, the broker may be required to pay the loan back.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Vernon says he was concerned that the entity holding Mr. Eastman\u2019s loans was something called Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, and not the brokerage business, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. He says he did not want a third party coming after his client later, so he argued that Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, not Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, should be a party to the arbitration case.

The current holding company, he said, was created in 2009, just weeks before the announcement that Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were combining their wealth management operations.        ', u'\n                    \u201cHaving them away from the broker-dealer just allows us to minimize the regulatory capital associated with them and operate the broker-dealer more efficiently,\u201d he explained to the three arbiters hearing his claim.        ', u'\n                    He said Morgan Stanley financed its broker-dealer \u201cwell in excess of the minimum capital requirement,\u201d so leaving the loans there might not necessarily affect how much capital the bank\u2019s broker-dealer has, but it \u201creduces the requirement if that was important at any point in time.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The arbitration was bittersweet for Mr. Eastman. While he received a lesson in Wall Street capital decisions, the arbitration panel denied Mr. Eastman\u2019s claims in March and ordered him to pay back roughly $200,000 of the $400,000 he owed the bank.

', u'\n                    And while analysts expect the results to show a sharp decline from last year\u2019s first quarter, in part because of disruptions in its Nigerian gas operations, many experts say Shell may eventually show big benefits from its natural gas emphasis.        ', u'\n                    Increasingly, to make gas a global commodity, companies supercool it into a liquid form for transport on specialized ships. Shell has already invested about $40 billion in liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., production plants, storage terminals and related systems, and plans to continue pumping money into that business.        ', u'\n                    Shell now has about 7 percent of the world L.N.G. business, with ambitions to more than double that share through new projects and acquisitions. Last year, L.N.G. and related businesses earned Shell $9.4 billion of its $25.1 billion in profit.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe are in the lead, and we want to stay in the lead,\u201d Andrew Brown, Shell\u2019s head of international exploration and production, said in a mid-April interview. Mr. Brown said Shell expected global demand for L.N.G. to grow rapidly in the coming years, doubling by 2025 to about 500 million tons a year, the equivalent of about 4.5 billion barrels of ', u', making it by far the fastest-growing fuel.        ', u'\n                    The main reason for the anticipated growth is that natural gas is abundant. And because of the U.S shale gas boom, it has become relatively cheap \u2014 especially in North America, where prices lately have been in the range of $4 per million British thermal units, compared with highs of $13 as recently as 2005. The European spot price is around $10 per million B.T.U.\u2019s, and the Asian price around $15; contract prices, often linked to oil, may be higher.        ', u'\n                    And because it burns much cleaner than either coal or oil, it will very likely stay in favor because its use can help lower the greenhouse gas emissions that are blamed for causing ', u'.        ', u'\n                    To Mr. Brown\u2019s frustration, not everyone gets the message. That is one reason Shell\u2019s big L.N.G. bet is no sure thing.        ', u'\n                    The United States has wholeheartedly embraced gas. But Europe, mired in economic doldrums, has turned to coal, which is less expensive. This has driven down demand for gas in the region, which in recent decades had been one of the world\u2019s biggest markets for natural gas via pipelines and L.N.G.        ', u'\n                    Europe does not have \u201cthe right balance\u201d in terms of promoting gas, Mr. Brown said. About 75 percent of Shell\u2019s L.N.G. goes to Asia.        ', u'\n                    As much as anyone, Mr. Brown is responsible for making Shell a gas broker to the world. Before taking his current job, Mr. Brown presided over more than $20 billion in investments in gargantuan installations for turning the extensive gas deposits in Qatar\u2019s North Field into exports in the form of L.N.G. and liquid fuels like diesel.        ', u'\n                    To build on its lead, Shell agreed in February to buy the L.N.G. business of the Spanish company Repsol for about $6.7 billion. Some industry analysts considered the price too high. But according to Repsol, Shell had to outbid more than dozen competing offers.        ', u'\n                    The impact of Shell\u2019s L.N.G. investments on the company\u2019s financial performance will, of course, fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The first-quarter results on Thursday are expected to be hurt by a shutdown at a Nigerian L.N.G. plant caused by sabotage. And yet, Shell\u2019s quarter was probably helped by high L.N.G. prices in Japan, which continues to import large quantities of gas since the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in 2011.        ', u'\n                    Analysts\u2019 consensus forecast anticipates that Shell will report adjusted net profit of $6 billion for the quarter, an 8 percent gain over the preceding quarter, but an 18 percent decline from a year earlier, according to Peter Hutton of RBC Capital Markets in London.        ', u'\n                    On Tuesday, one of Shell\u2019s main rivals, BP, ', u' of $4.2 billion after adjusting for inventory changes and one-time items, which handily beat analysts\u2019 forecasts. BP, though, continues to emphasize its oil business.        ', u'\n                    Over the longer run, being a big player in L.N.G. is likely to help Shell outearn its peers, predicted Martijn Rats, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. The huge upfront investments of several billion dollars per gas liquefaction plant might seem prohibitive, Mr. Rats said, but those projects \u201cgenerate large amounts of operating cash flow over two or three decades.\u201d        ', u'\n                    While L.N.G. projects may not have as high potential returns as some oil fields, it is less risky to build giant gas installations because much of the output is sold in advance and the plants require relatively little capital expenditure once up and running. The steady cash from L.N.G., which at current prices produces profit margins of 10 percent to 15 percent, can be used to finance riskier activities.        ', u'\n                    One risk for Shell is that an anticipated export surge from North America leads to a plunge in the much higher prices for gas in Europe and Asia.        ']), ([u'DEALBOOK; In Brown-Vitter Bill, a Bank Overhaul With Possible Teeth'], [u'\n                    The biggest banks have done an excellent job of delaying and undermining the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law and staving off criminal investigations into wrongdoing.\n        ', u'\n                    \nMaybe, just maybe, they\u2019ve been too successful.        ', u'\n                    Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat from Ohio, and ', u', Republican from Louisiana, introduced a bill last week that calls for two things: making the giant banks much safer and tying regulators\u2019 hands to prevent them from using taxpayer money to save a failing financial institution.        ', u'\n                    If the bankers who blew up the financial world had been held accountable, the popular fury that fuels this bill would have dissipated by now. And if Dodd-Frank were fully in place today, instead of being bogged down in the courts and in the halls of Washington regulatory offices, there would be no political momentum behind such an effort.        ', u'\n                    Now, we will see whether the bill is simply a barbaric yawp of anger at the big banks or something with actual force. It probably won\u2019t get passed, but its underlying premise cannot be dislodged from the Washington conversation.        ', u'\n                    The Brown-Vitter bill calls for the banks with more than $500 billion in assets \u2014 I\u2019m looking at you, ', u', ', u', ', u', ', u', ', u' and ', u' \u2014 to have capital reserves of 15 percent. That\u2019s a much higher standard than exists today, especially because the current requirements have weak definitions of capital and total asset size.        ', u'\n                    The banks have rounded up a bunch of critics, led by the likes of the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and the lobbying firm Hamilton Place Strategies, the volume of their lamentations most likely in direct proportion to the hourly rate they bill their clients. They invoke terrifying, talismanic statements: the bill is a \u201cpunishment\u201d to big banks. It is simplistic, impossible, will render American banks \u201cuncompetitive,\u201d lead to financial crises and probably cause tooth decay.        ', u'\n                    This na\xefve bill would force the giant banks to raise too much capital and would hurt the economy as the companies were forced to shrink or break up. Standard & Poor\u2019s is one of the observers warning of a financial crisis. And who better to know than the people who brought us the last one?        ', u'\n                    Goldman Sachs and S.& P. estimate the big banks might be forced to raise $1 trillion or more. That\u2019s a lot, so much that the leviathans\u2019 agents cry out that they couldn\u2019t sell that much stock. But they don\u2019t have to raise it all at once. And they can retain their earnings and stop paying dividends in addition to selling shares.        ', u'\n                    In putting that argument forward, they don\u2019t realize they make Senator Brown\u2019s and Senator Vitter\u2019s case for them. If investors are so terrified of the big banks that they won\u2019t buy their stock, that\u2019s a terrific problem. Most of the big banks trade below their net worth, an indication that investors don\u2019t trust them. Brown-Vitter might actually help banks by restoring that trust.        ', u'\n                    The Brown-Vitter bill serves as a good time to remind defenders of big banks what bank \u201ccapital\u201d is. As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig have pointed out in their ', u' \u201cThe Bankers\u2019 New Clothes,\u201d capital is not a rainy-day fund. It\u2019s not stored away in a vault somewhere, never to be touched. Capital \u2014 the rest of us know it as \u201cequity,\u201d like the down payment on a house \u2014 is simply money that absorbs losses. The more money a bank raises from shareholders, the more profit it keeps on hand, the less it has to borrow and the more solid it is. The bank can still lend that money. And if JPMorgan Chase doesn\u2019t lend to some small business, perhaps a regional or community bank will.        ', u'\n                    There might be some trade-offs to higher capital requirements, but we know there are costs to lower ones: financial crises. Some try to argue that the banks faced a liquidity crisis in 2008, what we call a run on the bank. Yes, that was true in the autumn of 2008. But the crisis didn\u2019t start then. It started in the late summer of 2007. If the banks had been more solidly capitalized, there would have been fewer panicked investors.        ', u'\n                    Banks desire as little capital as they can get away with. It\u2019s easier to make higher returns on equity with greater debt. Often management is paid in stock. But society as a whole doesn\u2019t benefit from banks that are running with too much leverage. They collapse.        ', u'\n                    So, it is better to have higher equity capital. But Brown-Vitter doesn\u2019t go far enough. The bill\u2019s definition of equity could be tighter. It still contains bookkeeping entries called intangible assets and deferred tax assets, which don\u2019t absorb losses.        ', u'\n                    But, gratifyingly, Brown-Vitter does tighten up the definition of assets. Capital is the numerator and assets are the denominator. Both need to be made as solid and trustworthy \u2014 and resistant to manipulation by banks or regulatory capture \u2014 as they can be. When calculating assets, Brown-Vitter tightens up rules on things like how the banks measure their exposure to derivatives.

But so far, the first-quarter results paint a somewhat encouraging picture of banks that have managed to limit losses from bad loans linked to the credit crisis, while reducing costs and returning to their core banking operations: credit and mortgages for some and wealth management for others.        ', u'\n                    UBS, for instance, reported on Tuesday a first-quarter profit of 988 million Swiss francs ($1 billion). Those results were down slightly from 1 billion francs in the period a year earlier, but far exceeded the 412 million francs predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Shares of UBS soared 5.67 percent in trading in Zurich on Tuesday.        ', u'\n                    Sergio P. Ermotti, the chief executive, cautioned that it was \u201ctoo early to declare victory,\u201d but said the earnings showed the company\u2019s \u201cbusiness model works in practice.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some investors note that the continuing difficulties in the euro zone and weak demand for loans mean that many European banks remain in trouble despite relatively good earnings in the first quarter.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThey are doing their utmost to have a decent banking model and the numbers across the board were very good, but going forward we now have the issue of where the growth is going to come from,\u201d said Florian Esterer, a fund manager at the MainFirst Group in Zurich.        ', u'\n                    Still, European banks are moving actively to address their problems, including by slashing costs in the face of changing regulations and a sluggish European economy. ', u' reported on Monday after the markets closed that its first-quarter profit rose as cost-cutting offset a decline in revenue from investment banking. Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock also rose 4.7 percent in Frankfurt on Tuesday on the news that it would issue new shares to bolster its capital reserves.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThere are still some headwinds, but banks are pretty much there when it comes to reaching the right level of capital and that is helpful,\u201d said Cormac Leech, an analyst at Liberum Capital.        ', u'\n                    UBS has been eliminating 10,000 jobs, reducing bonus payments, scaling back its investment banking trading business and focusing more on its successful wealth management operation. Those steps helped the bank\u2019s first-quarter results.        ', u'\n                    UBS, its Swiss rival ', u', and ', u' of Britain all benefited from higher revenue at its investment banking operation. At Credit Suisse, pretax profit in its investment banking division rose 43 percent, the bank said last week. Barclays, which also reported earnings last Wednesday, said pretax profit for its investment bank rose 11 percent in the quarter.        ', u'\n                    Reducing costs and shedding assets also helped Lloyds report a first-quarter net profit of \xa31.5 billion ($2.3 billion). Those results were a sharp turnaround from the \xa35 million loss Lloyds posted in the first quarter of 2012.        ', u'\n                    Analysts say European banks are also starting to recover from the fallout from numerous financial scandals that have hurt their reputations.        ', u'\n                    UBS, for example, has sought to rebuild trust among clients after it uncovered a $2.3 billion trading loss in 2011 connected with the activities of a former trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, who has since been sentenced to seven years in jail. In December, UBS said it would pay $1.5 billion in fines to settle a case related to the manipulation of the ', u', or Libor.        ', u'\n                    Many of the other large European banks have also been ensnared in the rate-rigging scandal. Deutsche Bank has set aside 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) to cover the potential cost of proceedings that include a tax evasion inquiry in Germany and an international investigation into accusations that its employees and those at other investment banks colluded to fix benchmark interest rates.        ', u'\n                    While financial institutions will continue to address such issues, there is a cautious optimism now about bank performance.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThere is a new appetite for banks among investors. There\u2019s a confidence that wasn\u2019t there two years ago,\u201d Mr. Leech said.

In a record-size bond deal, the company raised $17 billion, paying interest rates that hovered near the low-cost debt of the United States Treasury.        ', u'\n                    Apple\u2019s return to the debt markets raises a riddle: Why would a company with so much cash even bother to issue debt?        ', u'\n                    The answer has a lot to do with the frenzied state of the bond markets. Companies are issuing hundreds of billions of dollars in debt to exploit historically low interest rates. They are also feeding strong investor demand for high-quality corporate bonds as an alternative to money market funds and ', u', which are paying virtually nothing.        ', u'\n                    Apple\u2019s maneuver, however, also reflects the unusual challenges of a fabulously successful company with a sinking stock price. Apple is plagued by concerns that its growth may be slowing, and its shares have plummeted from a high last fall of more than $700 to under $400 last month.        ', u'\n                    In an effort to assuage a growing chorus of frustrated investors, the company is issuing bonds to help finance a $100 billion payout to shareholders. Apple said last week that it planned to distribute that amount by the end of 2015 in the form of paying increased dividends and buying back its stock. Since that announcement, Apple shares have risen 10 percent, closing at $442.78 on Tuesday        ', u'\n                    Taking on debt can actually magnify the returns for shareholders and improve stock performance, financial specialists say. It can reduce the overall cost of the capital that a company invests in its business. In addition, after a stock buyback, there are fewer shares, which can increase their value.        ', u'\n                    Yet even as shareholders and analysts welcome the financial tactics, they emphasize that the maker of iPhones, iPads and Macs must continue to innovate and fend off increasing competition. After all, today\u2019s Apple could be tomorrow\u2019s Palm.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThis is a substantial return of cash and it\u2019s the right thing to do on many levels,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cBut, ultimately, the company has to execute. This is no substitute for that.\u201d        ', u'\n                    By raising cheap debt for the shareholder payout, Apple also avoids a potentially big tax hit. About two-thirds of Apple\u2019s cash \u2014 about $102 billion \u2014 sits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions. If it returned some of that cash to the United States to reward its investors, it could have significant tax consequences for the company. In some ways, the bond issue is a response to that tax situation.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThey have been so successful with their tax planning that they\u2019ve created a new problem,\u201d said Martin A. Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a publisher of tax information. \u201cThey\u2019ve got so much money offshore.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The $17 billion debt sale by Apple is the largest corporate issuance on record, surpassing a $16.5 billion deal from the drug maker ', u' in 2009, according to Dealogic.        ', u'\n                    Apple joins a parade of large companies issuing debt with astonishingly low yields. Last week, ', u' sold bonds that mature in 10 years that yielded only 2.27 percent. In November, ', u' set the record for the lowest yield on a five-year bond, issuing the debt at 0.99 percent. In comparison, the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Tuesday was 1.67 percent, while the five-year note yielded 0.68 percent.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIf you look at these big companies like Apple and Microsoft doing these big, low-cost bond offerings, it\u2019s a way for them to raise money in an effort to create better returns for their shareholders,\u201d said Steven Miller, a credit analyst with ', u' Capital IQ. \u201cThe bond markets are practically begging these corporations to issue debt because of how cheap it is to raise money.\u201d        ', u'\n                    On Tuesday, Apple issued six different securities, with maturities ranging from a three-year note yielding 0.45 percent to a 30-year bond that yields 3.85 percent. The largest piece, a $5.5 billion issue, is a 10-year yielding 2.4 percent. While good for the company, longer-term bonds with yields this low can fall steeply in price if interest rates go up, hurting investors who hold them. Still, $3 billion of the Apple debt are notes whose interest rates are periodically reset.        ', u'\n                    Despite all the cash held by Apple, the credit-rating agencies have not awarded it their coveted AAA ratings, citing increased competition and a concern that its future product offerings could disappoint. ', u' gave Apple its second-highest rating, AA1, as did Standard & Poor\u2019s, rating the company AA+. (Microsoft, ', u', ', u', and ', u' have the highest credit ratings from ', u' and S.&.

', u'\n                    \u201cThere are inherent long-run risks for any company with high exposure to shifting consumer preferences in the rapidly evolving technology and wireless communications sectors,\u201d wrote Gerald Granovsky, a Moody\u2019s analyst.        ', u'\n                    Apple\u2019s less-than-perfect rating did not drive away investors on Tuesday. The offering generated investor demand of about $52 billion, according to ', u' and ', u', which led the sale of the issuance.        ', u'\n                    Desperate for returns in a yield-starved world, investors like insurance companies, pension funds and foreign governments have been snapping up corporate debt. Individual investors are also driving the demand: this year, through last Wednesday, a record $55 billion has flowed into mutual funds and ', u' that invest in corporate debt with high-quality ratings, according to the fund data provider Lipper.        ', u'\n                    ', u', Apple\u2019s co-founder and former chief executive, had long resisted calls to dispense big sums to investors. In 2010, when Apple\u2019s cash stood at $50 billion, he rejected pressure to make large distributions to shareholders. The company\u2019s cash balance continued to grow after Mr. Jobs\u2019s death in 2011, as it generated billions of dollars in earnings each quarter. Over the last 12 months, Apple operations have been generating about $150 million of cash a day.        ', u'\n                    A year ago, the new chief executive, ', u', announced a decision to start returning $45 billion to shareholders. But that did not satisfy everyone. David Einhorn, chief executive of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital and an Apple shareholder, pressed the company to do even more.        ', u'\n                    The excitement surrounding Apple\u2019s bond deal on Tuesday stood in stark contrast to the gloom that hung over the company when it last issued debt. In 1996, Apple faced a crisis, with shrinking sales of its niche computers and a weakening balance sheet that earned a junk credit rating. In the middle of the year, its shares reached a 10-year low.

', u'\n                    There are several different kinds of audits, Mr. Smith, a former tax lawyer, said in a telephone interview. Correspondence audits are conducted by mail, and generally relate to a specific item on your return, or small dollar amounts. With a \u201cdesk\u201d audit, you may have to go to an I.R.S. office and meet with a revenue agent.

That scenario (surprise) apparently doesn\u2019t really happen too often. An \u201coffice\u201d audit, in which the I.R.S. comes to you, is generally just done for businesses.

The request will specify what documents the agency is requesting and will state the deadlines for providing them.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Smith conceded that he might be biased, but if you haven\u2019t been working with a tax professional, like an accountant or tax attorney, you might want to retain one if you have been selected for audit. Even if the issue raised in the audit is relatively simple, and you have all the relevant documentation requested, there are procedural hurdles and deadlines that must be met to help things go smoothly.        ', u'\n                    \u201cBe honest about whether it makes sense to hire a professional,\u201d he said. If you\u2019ve prepared your own return, and the agency is making a simple request for, say, receipts for a charitable deduction \u2014 and you know you have them \u2014 it may be fine to handle it on your own. But if the amount in question is large, or the tax issue complex, think hard before handling it yourself. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want to do is go in, make mistakes, get a giant bill from the I.R.S. and then contact a professional to say, \u2018Get me out of this,\u2019\u201d he said.

You can agree with the finding, at which point the agency will assess the deficiency and collect it.        ', u'\n                    If you disagree, you usually have 30 days to protest.

And it comes a day after Sprint won permission from SoftBank to begin limited talks with the latest suitor to determine whether the new proposal was likely to become a superior offer.        ', u'\n                    Dish has argued that its cash-and-stock bid for all of Sprint, valued at $7 a share, would create a new wireless titan whose phone, data and video services would rival those from ', u' Wireless and AT&T.        ', u'\n                    For now, Mr. Son insists that his earlier proposal, a two-step process that would leave 30 percent of Sprint publicly traded, is straightforward and can be completed by mid-July. The first part of the process, in which SoftBank invested $3.1 billion in the American company to keep it afloat, has already been completed.        ', u'\n                    \u201cCharlie\u2019s proposal does not provide any new cash into the company, and it provides heavy burden of debt,\u201d Mr. Son said in a telephone interview. \u201cI believe our deal will go through.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Son said he was not surprised by the arrival of Mr. Ergen, who has publicly amassed a cash hoard that many assumed would finance some sort of acquisition. Though Dish had already made a play for ', u', he said he guessed that the satellite TV company had even bigger ambitions.        ', u'\n                    \u201cMy guess was right,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    He repeatedly attacked Dish\u2019s bid as unworkable and his rival\u2019s numbers as misleading. By his own reckoning, factoring in both cost savings and potential costs like delays, SoftBank\u2019s offer was worth $7.65 a share, while Dish\u2019s was valued at $6.31. People close to Dish dispute that calculation, arguing that it includes a number of questionable assumptions.        ', u'\n                    Chief among Mr. Son\u2019s criticisms was the amount of debt that the competing offer would pile on to Sprint, which he estimated at $50 billion. In a long presentation to SoftBank\u2019s shareholders, Mr. Son argued that his proposal would increase Sprint\u2019s debt by three times, while Dish\u2019s would do so by nearly six times. \u201cIt would be prohibitively high debt,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    While Dish has trumpeted the amount of wireless spectrum the combined company would control, Mr. Son argued that the holdings would be excessive and expensive to maintain. And it would still require spending what he estimated was $6 billion to upgrade Sprint\u2019s network, while facing pressure to make use of its own spectrum holdings within the next four years.        ', u'\n                    And Mr. Son contended that Mr. Ergen, a wily deal maker whose net worth Forbes estimates is more than $10 billion, is an amateur when it comes to the mobile industry. By contrast, he pointed repeatedly to SoftBank\u2019s rise over the last seven years to become one of Japan\u2019s three biggest wireless companies.        ', u'\n                    For its part, Dish said in a statement: \u201cWe remain confident that the Sprint board will share our view that the Dish proposal is superior by offering Sprint shareholders greater value with a higher price and more cash, while also creating the opportunity to participate meaningfully in a combined, and competitively unique, Dish/Sprint.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Much of SoftBank\u2019s hopes are tied to Sprint\u2019s bid to buy the remainder of Clearwire, an offer that has drawn significant shareholder opposition.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Son dismissed concerns about the proposal\u2019s fate, saying that Sprint has not signaled any desire or need to raise its current offer of $2.97 a share. The company can\u2019t raise its bid without the blessing of its benefactor, SoftBank.        ', u'\n                    In the worst case, Sprint will raise its ownership in Clearwire to about 65 percent from 50 percent through agreements to buy out partners in the company, including ', u' and Brighthouse.        ', u'\n                    Speaking of dissident investors who think Sprint\u2019s offer is too low, Mr. Son said, \u201cThey can stay as shareholders for however long they want. We are happy with just 65 percent.\u201d        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

But the dirty secret of venture capital is that the dream can be dashed as the venture capitalists make millions in a sale, leaving the founders with nothing.\n        ', u'\n                    \nA recent Delaware court case arising from the 2011 sale of Bloodhound Technologies illustrates how this happens.        ', u'\n                    Bloodhound was founded in the mid-1990s by Joseph A. Carsanaro to create fraud-monitoring software for health care claims. After several years of going it alone with a handful of colleagues, Mr. Carsanaro was able to raise Bloodhound\u2019s first venture capital round for $1.9 million in 1999, followed by a second $3.1 million round in 2000.        ', u'\n                    When the Internet bubble burst, the company underwent rocky times. It was then that the venture capitalists seized control. Mr. Carsanaro was pushed out as chief executive. By 2000, he was gone from the company, as were four other members of his founding team.        ', u'\n                    For the next decade, Bloodhound recovered and slowly grew, raising seven more rounds of financing. In April 2011, the company was sold for $82.5 million. It was a time for Mr. Carsanaro and his founding team to celebrate their millionaire status.        ', u'\n                    But venture capital investments are structured to ensure that the venture capitalists are paid before founders and employees. When venture capitalists invest, they typically demand preferred shares that accrue a yearly dividend of about 8 percent. The dividend goes unpaid until the company is sold. In a sale, the original amount and the interest all come due. It must be paid out before the common shares, which are typically held by the founders and other employees.        ', u'\n                    The requirement that the venture capitalist be paid first, and with interest, can sometimes hit founders and employees in a brutal manner, as Mr. Carsanaro and his colleagues discovered.        ', u'\n                    The venture capitalists took almost all of the sale price. Bloodhound also paid a $15 million bonus to its current management team. The five founders of Bloodhound were paid in total less than $36,000. One received all of $99.        ', u'\n                    There is not much information on payouts to founders and employees when a company backed by venture capital is sold. But from the few studies on the subject, it appears that the situation involving Bloodhound is all too common.        ', u'\n                    The ', u', by Profs. Brian J. Broughman and Jesse M. Fried, found that among a sample of venture capital deals, the common investors in roughly half the cases were entitled to nothing when the company was sold, even when the sale was for tens of millions. And in all but one instance, the majority of the sale proceeds went to the venture capitalists and other holders of preferred shares.        ', u'\n                    An ', u'by Shikhar Ghosh at the Harvard Business School found that three out of four companies backed by venture capital did not return the investment. Again, it is in these cases where the founders and employees typically are entitled to receive no payment.        ', u'\n                    For those entrepreneurs who think they will be the next ', u' and ride their company to riches, think again. A ', u' have found that most chief executives of companies that take venture capital investments end up being replaced.        ', u'\n                    These are the successful businesses. The rule of thumb among venture capitalists is that some 20 percent to 30 percent of companies fail, returning nothing to any investor, including the venture capitalists.        ', u'\n                    The Bloodhound case is a reminder that the founders of start-ups backed by venture capital often end up nothing like Mr. Zuckerberg. Instead, they find themselves thrown out and without significant profits even if their company is sold.        ', u'\n                    Venture capitalists will argue that this is the price to pay to get their money and services. Cash is king, and in order to survive, venture capitalists will demand a high price and return.        ', u'\n                    Yet entrepreneurs can protect themselves. Professors Broughman and Fried found in their study that founders who negotiated greater control rights ended up receiving on average $3.7 million more. They did this even when the common shareholders were not entitled to a dime. By negotiating board seats or other representation, the founders were able to ensure that a sale happened only with their approval and a demand for some payment in return.        ', u'\n                    In other words, the rights negotiated by entrepreneurs when taking venture capital money really matter. Many entrepreneurs are so excited to get money that they don\u2019t push for such rights or just don\u2019t know to ask. Yet those who negotiate to keep a say in their company have a future, while those who don\u2019t are more likely to be tossed aside. And it can be that this happens even in lucrative situations. Remember that Mr. Zuckerberg would have been forced by his venture capital investors to sell ', u' had he not kept control.        ', u'\n                    In the case of Bloodhound, its founders were pushed out of the company about eight years before the sale. During that time, they lacked control or ability to stop the venture capitalists from financing the company on the venture capitalists\u2019 terms. The only substantial communication the founders had after they left was when they found out that the company had been sold for a huge price and that they would receive almost nothing.        ', u'\n                    The five founders sued in Delaware court, claiming that Bloodhound\u2019s board and the venture capitalists had structured later rounds to favor themselves and dilute the payout of the founders. In a motion, the defendants countered that they acted fairly and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were untimely because they were brought years later.        ', u'\n                    J. Travis Laster, vice chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court, ', u'that the venture capitalist had favored themselves to the detriment of the founders could be a viable claim claim if the facts they stated were true.        ', u'\n                    If Bloodhound\u2019s founders are successful in their lawsuit, the case could change practices. It might require boards that take venture capital money to consider the founders and their interests before taking the next round. This could force boards to lean against diluting the payout of the founders and employees to avoid litigation.        ', u'\n                    Yet even if Bloodhound\u2019s founders prevail, other entrepreneurs will sometimes find that their company is sold with nothing going to them. The sad reality is that there are times when the price demanded by the venture capitalists for the company to survive means that the founders will lose. Let\u2019s face it, sometimes the company survives only because of that money and the skill and effort that the venture capitalists put in. This may have been the case in Bloodhound.        ', u'\n                    But the Bloodhound case publicizes this practice and will perhaps push boards to think harder before the founders are discarded. This may foster caution among venture capitalists, but the only thing that will truly save entrepreneurs is negotiating harder in the beginning. They may otherwise find themselves like the Bloodhound founders, left with nothing.

', u'\n                    Banks also face a deadline to meet new global standards known as Basel III, which began taking effect this year. Deutsche Bank said the share sale and other measures would raise the ratio of capital to assets, as defined by the new rules, to 9.5 percent from 8.8 percent at the end of the quarter. That is comfortably above capital requirements that are being phased in through the beginning of 2019.        ', u'\n                    Deutsche Bank executives had earlier grumbled about the new rules, saying they were unnecessarily restrictive.

The sale will increase the number of existing shares by about 10 percent and could reduce the size of the dividend that shareholders would otherwise receive. Deutsche Bank said it would sell the shares privately to institutional investors and would not sell them publicly.

Their list includes brands like Pepsi, Mercedes-Benz and Louis Vuitton; politicians like Newt Gingrich, Representative Jared Polis and Dmitri Medvedev, the Russian prime minister; and the rappers 50 Cent and Sean Combs, known as Diddy.        ', u'\n                    Social media experts say there are several reasons why Twitter users would want to acquire large volumes of Twitter followers. For some people, it simply feeds the ego. For people and brands, a large Twitter following or Facebook fan base helps increase their visibility. If followers are constantly clicking on links to a brand\u2019s landing page, it also lifts the brand\u2019s position in Google\u2019s search results.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s natural for brands to want to build their Twitter and Facebook accounts because they are constantly looking for ways to expand awareness of their products and services and expand opportunities to create consideration of their products compared to others,\u201d said Susan Etlinger, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. \u201cThe more content they publish, and more links people click on, the better their Google search results. \u201d        ', u'\n                    Ms. Etlinger added that there was corporate pressure to justify a company\u2019s investment in social media. Twitter followers and Facebook \u201clikes\u201d offer some of the few seemingly hard metrics in an otherwise squishy realm of social media.        ', u'\n                    \u201cMany brands struggle to measure the top line value of social media,\u201d Ms. Etlinger said. \u201cSo there is a thirst to show momentum in different ways, one of which is to show that the brand has a bigger audience today than it did yesterday.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some major brands have expressed skepticism about the impact of social media fans and followers. Last month, Coca-Cola, whose flagship brand has over 700,000 Twitter followers and more than 60 million Facebook fans \u2014 more than any other brand on Facebook \u2014 said a corporate study found that online buzz had no quantifiable impact on short-term sales.        ', u'\n                    Social media fans and followers tend to be volatile, brand experts say. They may start following a brand for a specific contest or sweepstakes, then drop off when the campaign ends. But Mr. Stroppa and Mr. De Micheli said the follower changes they charted were drastic enough to warrant suspicion that they were purchased.        ', u'\n                    For example, Mr. Polis, a Democrat from Colorado with 22,140 Twitter followers on his personal @jaredpolis Twitter account, gained, on average, 15 new followers a day for two years. Then, last July, he added 19,705 new Twitter followers. A few months later, he lost 13,332 Twitter followers in one day.        ', u'\n                    A representative for Mr. Polis denied he had purchased fake followers and said one explanation for the sudden gains and subsequent losses was a \u201cfollow-back\u201d campaign. Last July, Mr. Polis said he followed a large number of new people from his personal account and asked them to follow him back. In March, he said he stopped following those accounts because he was becoming frustrated by the lack of relevant content in his Twitter feed. He now follows only 2,200 people. He surmised that a large number of followers may have stopped following him, too.        ', u'\n                    But Mr. De Micheli said that reasoning does not justify the sudden 19,705 jump in Mr. Polis\u2019s followers in one day. Twitter\u2019s own policy prevents users from following over 1,000 new people a day: \u201cEvery Twitter account is technically unable to follow more than 1,000 users per day,\u201d Twitter says on ', u'. \u201cPlease note that this is just a technical limit to prevent egregious abuse from spam accounts.\u201d        ', u'\n                    As for the sudden drop, Mr. De Micheli said it would be extremely rare for 13,332 followers to stop following the congressman on the same day. To have them stop following his account, Mr. Polis would have had to block 13,332 people manually, since the only way to stop an account from following you is to manually block it.        ', u'\n                    \u201cNearly the exact amount of followers \u2018magically appeared,\u2019 then disappeared,\u201d Mr. De Micheli said. He suggested that the losses was more likely due to Twitter, which routinely deactivates accounts it deems fake.\xa0 He said Mr. Polis\u2019s follower drop matched \u201cwhat the typical \u2018low quality\u2019 fake followers acquisition-drop graph looks like\u201d when Twitter deletes those accounts.        ', u'\n                    The researchers also call out Diddy, whose verified @iamdiddy account gained 185,399 Twitter followers one day last June \u2014 a 3,063 percent increase from the account\u2019s average daily gain \u2014 and then inexplicably lost 393,665 followers one day last month, 6,504 percent more that his average daily follower loss. \xa0A representative for Mr. Combs did not return a request for comment.

', u'\n                    The arguments seem to run contrary to long-standing beliefs about homeownership. For decades, experts have emphasized the need for a sizable down payment \u2014 a rule of thumb being 20 percent \u2014 on the premise that borrowers with a sizable chunk of equity in a home are less likely to walk away when things get bad.

Willen, a senior economist and policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.        ', u'\n                    The issue may not be so black and white. Regulators want to protect borrowers and promote homeownership. But they also want to encourage lending and insulate the financial system from future shocks.        ', u'\n                    And the subprime debacle has only distorted the debate, say some analysts. \u201cThe problem with this conversation is that it\u2019s like discussing the future of shipbuilding from the deck of the Titanic,\u201d said Roberto G. Quercia, director of the Center for Community Capital at the ', u' at Chapel Hill. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of perspective.\u201d        ', u'\n                    To underscore his point, Mr. Quercia studied mortgages in a special program for low-income borrowers, typically those with minimal down payments. From 1998 through the end of last year, 5.5 percent of the mortgages ended up in foreclosure, he found. Subprime mortgages made during the last housing boom, regardless of down payment size, had far higher foreclosure rates, roughly 25 percent.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s a critical issue for Washington. Currently, taxpayers, through the ', u', backstop most of the low-down-payment mortgages. But the aim is to curb the government\u2019s involvement in mortgages.        ', u'\n                    As that happens, policy makers are hoping a major part of the mortgage market will come back. Specifically, they need the return of private bond investors, who once bought trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of mortgage-backed bonds with no government backing.        ', u'\n                    Other than some small bond deals, that market remains dormant. A major reason is that the banks that sell the mortgage-backed bonds are waiting for regulators to complete rules aimed at strengthening this market.        ', u'\n                    This is where down payments could play a crucial role. The proposed rules require banks to hold a slice of the mortgage-backed bonds they sell to investors. Banks do not like those types of restrictions.        ', u'\n                    But lenders would not have to keep a piece of the bonds if the underlying loans included features that made them less likely to default. These exempt loans would be called qualified residential mortgages. Regulators effectively proposed that these loans should have a 20 percent down payment.        ', u'\n                    The proposal prompted widespread objections from consumer advocates, bankers and home builders, who said the plan could shut many borrowers out of the housing market. Banks, they argued, are likely to focus heavily on making qualified residential mortgages. And if those mortgages require high down payments, lenders will be hesitant to make loans with little money down.        ', u'\n                    Consumer advocates make a nuanced case. They do not deny that down payments reduce the risk of default. But they say defaults can be reduced almost as much by applying other rules that curb lending to certain types of borrowers.        ', u'\n                    Consider another set of mortgage rules, already put in place this year. These rules emphasize the affordability of the loan. Under them, a borrower\u2019s overall monthly debt payments cannot exceed 43 percent of personal income.        ', u'\n                    In his study, Professor Quercia of the University of North Carolina found that loans that complied with those rules defaulted at a relatively low rate during the housing bust. About 5.8 percent of them went bad, irrespective of how much the borrower put down.        ', u'\n                    He then calculated the losses on loans to borrowers in the same group who had down payments of at least 20 percent. The default rate on that smaller group was lower, at 3.9 percent.        ', u'\n                    But that lower rate came at a cost. More than half of the borrowers in his study group had to be excluded from the second calculation, because they didn\u2019t have down payments of 20 percent or more. This shows how restrictive a down payment rule could be, said Professor Quercia.        ', u'\n                    Some real estate analysts are skeptical of this approach. They assert that the new mortgage rules, which do not insist on down payments, may be relatively ineffective at preventing high levels of defaults.        ', u'\n                    The debt-payments-to-income ratio is not a strong predictor of whether a loan will default, said Thomas A. Lawler, a former chief economist of ', u' who founded Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, a research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s not even in the top three,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Also, Mr. Lawler and others who favor higher down payments argue that Professor Quercia\u2019s analysis underestimates the psychological and practical importance of the down payment. Borrowers who saved up for down payments may have budgeting skills that later help them make their payments, they argue, and borrowers with equity in their homes are less likely to walk away altogether, rather than try to find a solution.        ', u'\n                    Supporters of a down payment requirement also make a broader argument. They point out that the financial sector overhaul was not just meant to protect borrowers. It was also intended to make banks and financial markets more resilient to shocks like housing busts. In other words, the legislation always envisioned a trade-off between homeownership and the stability of the financial system.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe key is what is the right balance between some risk and access,\u201d Professor Quercia said. \u201cJust looking at the risks is one-sided.\u201d        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

But instead of taking aim at storefront payday lenders, the banking authorities are focusing on the small operations\u2019 big bank rivals, like ', u' and U.S. Bank, according to several people briefed on the matter.        ', u'\n                    A handful of banks offer the loans tied to checking accounts, with the understanding that the lender can automatically withdraw the loan amount, plus the origination fee, when it is due.

', u'\n                    The F.D.I.C. and the comptroller\u2019s office declined to comment.        ', u'\n                    The regulators are expected to impose more stringent requirements on the loans. Before making a loan, for example, banks will have to assess a consumer\u2019s ability to repay the money.        ', u'\n                    Banking authorities are also expected to institute a mandatory cooling-off period of 30 days between loans \u2014 a reform intended to halt what consumer advocates call a debt spiral of borrowers taking out fresh loans to cover their outstanding debt. As part of that, banks will not be able to extend a new loan until a borrower has paid off any previous ones.        ', u'\n                    Another requirement, the people said, will address marketing. Because the advances are not typically described as loans, the interest rates are largely opaque to borrowers. Wells Fargo, for example, charges $1.50 for every $20 borrowed. While the bank\u2019s Web site warns that the products are \u201cexpensive,\u201d there is no calculation of an interest rate. The banking regulators will require that banks disclose the interest rates, according to the people familiar with the guidance.        ', u'\n                    Some of the guidelines would hew closely to mortgage rules already required under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Under the law, lenders have to calculate a customer\u2019s ability to shoulder the principal and interest payments over the life of a mortgage.        ', u'\n                    The loans have proliferated since the financial crisis, according to consumer advocates \u2014 spurred in part by banks\u2019 aggressive search for fresh revenue after losing billions of dollars in income from regulations that restrict fees on debit and credit cards.        ', u'\n                    Banks deny that the loans are predatory and point out that lenders are simply catering to demand from consumers.

', u'\n                    For low-income consumers, the loans can result in a torrent of overdraft charges and fees. Borrowers who take out payday loans are roughly two times as likely to be hit with overdraft fees, according to a March report by the Center for Responsible Lending, an advocacy group.        ', u'\n                    The impact of the loans can be devastating for seniors, according to the report, because ', u' and disability payments deposited directly into checking accounts can be siphoned to satisfy fees incurred by the loan.

', u'\n                    She vows every month to never take out the high-cost credit again, she said, but each month a slew of bills undermines that promise. To cover the cost of the loan, the bank draws from Ms. Smith\u2019s Social Security income after her benefits of about $1,200 a month are deposited in her account.

On Wednesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a report that found the payday and direct-deposit loans could transform from short-term credit into a long-term burden. \u201cFor too many consumers, payday and deposit advance loans are debt traps,\u201d Richard Cordray, the agency\u2019s director, said in a statement.

Business groups have railed against the law, criticizing it for chilling overseas business expansion and failing to provide companies with bright-line rules for how to conduct themselves overseas. Foreign companies doing business in the United States, as well as those listed on American stock exchanges, also must comply with the statute.        ', u'\n                    Several lawmakers have criticized the Justice Department, saying it was not doing enough to enforce the law. Specifically, they argue that there are not enough prosecutions of individual executives. Most foreign bribery cases, including the one involving Ralph Lauren, are brought only against the companies. Critics say that the corporate fines are insufficient to deter such acts and are simply added to the cost of doing business overseas.

It has the elements of a farce, and Dell\u2019s board has no one to blame but itself.\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe fizzled bidding for Dell is a result of the board\u2019s extreme reliance on a process known as a go-shop and how it ran the initial sale. If this episode does not change the way companies sell themselves, perhaps it should.        ', u'\n                    A go-shop is a device that companies started using about a decade ago. The go-shop typically provides that after a deal is announced, the target company shops like ', u', as a Delaware judge once put it, looking to see if another bidder is willing to compete.        ', u'\n                    Why would the first bidder allow this?        ', u'\n                    The answer lies in its origins. Go-shops were first used in private equity buyouts. The private equity firm would often team with management to make a bid, demanding exclusive negotiations. Boards would agree to this exclusivity but in exchange demand a period of time when alternative bids could be solicited. This way they could be assured that the company was being sold for the highest possible price.        ', u'\n                    Yet there is also plenty of skepticism about this process. The conventional wisdom is that go-shops are a hollow ritual. The feel-good perception that the company is being actively shopped covers up the fact that the initial bidder has a perhaps unbeatable head start. Once a deal is announced, others don\u2019t have time to catch up, nor do they want to get in a bidding war. A go-shop becomes just a cover-up for a pre-chosen deal.        ', u'\n                    There is truth to this. At least one study has found that go-shops don\u2019t generally attract higher-valued bids when management and private equity firms are involved. This makes sense. After all, if the original bidding group has management locked up, how is a subsequent bidder going to run the company?        ', u'\n                    Despite such concerns, the Dell board used both exclusivity and a go-shop in structuring the sale process, although it did add some frills to try to protect shareholders further.        ', u'\n                    Instead of running an open auction contest at the very beginning, the Dell board negotiated with the private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and ', u'. When K.K.R. dropped out, the board asked TPG to join the process.        ', u'\n                    But the board focused on only two bidders at a time and didn\u2019t reach out to others. Instead, when Blackstone called about a deal in January, it was left to bid only in the go-shop after it was announced that ', u' and Silver Lake were offering $13.65 a share to take Dell private.        ', u'\n                    It is curious that the Dell board adopted the go-shop process so wholeheartedly. Even in the best of circumstances, they are seldom successful. Since 2004 there have been 196 transactions with go-shops in them, according to the research provider FactSet MergerMetrics. In only 6.6 percent of these did another bidder compete during the go-shop period. More than 93 percent of deals with go-shops do not attract competing bids.        ', u'\n                    You can slot Dell into the overwhelming majority. The Dell board hired Evercore to run the go-shop, and the investment bank contacted 71 parties. Now Dell appears left with only ', u'.        ', u'\n                    It might have turned out differently, if the board had pulled Blackstone fully into the sale process before the announcement of an agreement to sell the company to Silver Lake and Mr. Dell. By failing to include Blackstone \u2014 with its growing technology practice that includes a former executive of Dell \u2014 from the get-go, it allowed the go-shop process to unfold in the harsh glare of the media.        ', u'\n                    And when your business is something like a melting ice cube, time matters. A recent International Data Corporation report showed the PC business in a free fall, with United States shipments down 12.7 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous year, and Dell falling behind its competitors. The deterioration in the business was one of the reasons Blackstone decided not to bid.        ', u'\n                    Hindsight is 20-20, of course. Still, Dell\u2019s board should have known that how it ran the sale would come under harsh scrutiny. Dell\u2019s biggest shareholder outside of Mr. Dell, Southeastern Asset Management, had told the Dell board before the proposed buyout was announced that it would not support a transaction where it could not roll over its shares and that was not in the range of $14 to $15 a share, according to a securities filing. That Southeastern is now heavily protesting this deal is no surprise.        ', u'\n                    People close to Dell vigorously defend the sale process, calling the go-shop a \u201csuccess\u201d since it brought Blackstone even this close to bidding.        ', u'\n                    But Dell\u2019s use of the go-shop now leaves its shareholders with a hollow choice. Silver Lake and Mr. Dell will most likely wait it out, possibly raising their offer a quarter or two at the last minute to win over shareholder holdouts. They certainly have no incentive to do anything before then or to do much more, if even that. And then shareholders will be forced to vote between this deal and taking the risk with a still publicly traded company that Blackstone has now so publicly spurned. It\u2019s really not much of a choice.        ', u'\n                    Moreover, there will now be furious lobbying by Southeastern and Mr. Icahn to have equity stakes in a newly private Dell rather than take the buyout offer. Southeastern wants to salvage its investment in Dell \u2014 its cost basis in the stock is above the current offer price. But it appears the fund has little leverage unless it can persuade these now doubly cowed public shareholders to play a game of chicken with Mr. Dell.        ', u'\n                    At this point, it is simply speculation whether there could have been a healthy bidding war for Dell. Yet there are lessons here for companies that use go-shops in the future.        ', u'\n                    The risk that the process leaves shareholders with no real choice is particularly keen when management is involved. Dell\u2019s board went admirably out of its way to secure the cooperation of Mr. Dell with any winning bidder, but even then it appears that he was not so willing to cooperate with Blackstone, as Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times noted in his column.        ', u'\n                    Running a full auction of a company beforehand when there is leverage to fully secure management\u2019s cooperation appears to be the better course.        ', u'\n                    In other words, the next time a company says that the price being paid to shareholders will be a good one because they have a go-shop, be wary. And as for directors, when executives from a private equity firm with $51 billion in assets under management comes knocking on your door, you might not want to turn them away.

Every time an explosive comes into contact with air it creates a unique vapor trail, a unique signature. So the signature for TNT is different than the signature for C4. By deploying this low-cost chip technology, the thesis was, one could build a very, very low cost, very ubiquitous detector grid that you could then deploy in things like mailboxes, lamp posts, airports, etc.        ', u'\n                    The frustration we ultimately found was at that time I think the attention of the venture capital community had already shifted away from homeland and global security back to the Internet, particularly the consumer Internet.

(Microsoft has been testing the service with customers for the past year.) And to make sure it\u2019s taken seriously, Microsoft is committing to match Amazon\u2019s prices for its cloud service, which is known as the Elastic Compute Cloud.

', u'\n                    For its first foray into the business a few years ago with a service called Windows Azure, Microsoft settled on an approach that played to its strengths, offering customers the ability to rent applications like databases and servers for broadcasting video. Amazon, in contrast, was known for more minimalist, low-level services \u2014 storage space on its servers, computing time and a share of its Internet connections.        ', u'\n                    If Microsoft\u2019s offering was akin to a garage space outfitted with an arsenal power of tools, Amazon was renting just the garage.

While the big companies targeted by Microsoft for its initial Windows Azure services will likely move to aggressively embrace the cloud at some point, the most ardent cloud supporters right now are technically sophisticated start-ups.

What\u2019s more, the officials say that the S.E.C. opened fewer investigations in the 2012 fiscal year than the previous year, presenting a potential obstacle to Mr. Ceresney, who will take the reins with George Canellos, an agency veteran.

', u'\n                    While at Debevoise, Mr. Ceresney represented a number of the nation\u2019s largest banks, including ', u' during an inquiry involving its foreclosure practices. Mr. Ceresney is expected to recuse himself from cases involving his former clients.        ', u'\n                    The S.E.C.\u2019s caseload presents another test for Mr. Ceresney. In addition to the dwindling number of actions, the S.E.C. is unlikely to catch any breaks from the courts. The Supreme Court recently rejected the agency\u2019s argument that it should have additional time before the statute of limitations in fraud cases expires.

On Monday, the bill cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, setting it up for a vote this week, and President Obama said he supported it.        ', u'\n                    Over the weekend, John Donahoe, eBay\u2019s chief executive, sent out an audacious e-mail to tens of millions of eBay merchants, pleading with them to write their representatives in Congress to block the legislation.

', u'\n                    It isn\u2019t until the end of Mr. Donahoe\u2019s letter that he argues for a compromise. If there is action, he wrote, the bill should be changed so that a small business is defined as making less than $10 million in out-of-state sales or having fewer than 50 employees. \u201cTo put that in perspective, Amazon does more than $10 million of sales every 90 minutes.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Donahoe, who deserves credit for turning around eBay in recent years, isn\u2019t trying to protect the mom-and-pop store or the struggling artist, he\u2019s trying to keep substantial businesses with real revenue from paying taxes.        ', u'\n                    When I asked an eBay spokeswoman to quantify how many eBay sellers would be affected by the legislation if it were not raised to the $10 million cap, she said she did not have a number. (Considering the amount of money and energy eBay is spending on its lobbying effort, you\u2019d think it would be able to quantify the cost.)        ', u'\n                    Part of eBay\u2019s argument is that it is too complicated and expensive for small merchants to collect the tax. \u201cAre you prepared to collect sales taxes in the more than 9,600 tax jurisdictions across the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Donahoe asked.        ', u'\n                    What Mr. Donahoe did not mention is that Amazon will already collect this tax for merchants if they ask, and eBay will help provide them with third-party technology services that will help them do this, too. There are a number of companies that will manage and streamline the process, like Avalara or TaxCloud. And you have to believe that if the bill gets passed, there will be a cottage industry of companies that will offer services to collect the tax, including eBay, which has made a reputation trying to streamline the selling process for merchants. In fairness, eBay also argues that a cost of complying with enforcement will be a nightmare. Think about the prospect of an out-of-state tax audit.        ', u'\n                    Before we continue, a little history: the reason the online merchants don\u2019t have to collect sales tax is a function of the Supreme Court ruling in 1992 in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota. In that case, Quill, a mail-order office equipment retailer, was sued over what North Dakota said was taxes due because Quill shipped products to the state. The court ruled that merchants did not have to collect taxes in a state unless they had a physical presence in the state. This covered mail-order businesses and, yes, the then-nascent business of Internet retailing. (Amazon didn\u2019t even exist then.)        ', u'\n                    A note to readers, and to self: If you live in a state with a sales tax, you are supposed to submit uncollected taxes on Internet purchases at the end of the year, even if the merchant doesn\u2019t seek it at the time of the sale. Of course, nobody does that.        ', u'\n                    At a time when states are desperate for revenue, you can see the allure of taxing online merchants. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, $23 billion is lost annually from out-of-state sales, a considerable portion from online transactions.

', u'\n                    But on the flip side, there is an argument that the current state of sales taxes online is regressive for consumers.

And perhaps more important, it is moving to build physical warehouse and shipping centers in many states so that it can offer faster delivery services, in some cases within 24 hours. That means it would most likely have had to collect sales tax anyway.

', u'\n                    The delay involves a crucial but little-noticed part of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping financial sector overhaul that Congress passed in July 2010. One part of the legislation focused on the Fed. While the government used many different tools to shore up the financial system during the crisis, Congress was well aware that the Fed played a decisive role.        ', u'\n                    The central bank made huge loans to scores of domestic and foreign banks as markets seized up, dwarfing bailouts like the Troubled Asset Relief Program. But the identities of the borrowers were not disclosed at first, stoking concerns that the Fed had carried out a vast stealth bailout of Wall Street.        ', u'\n                    Against that backdrop, Dodd-Frank required the Fed to develop policies and procedures to safeguard taxpayers when making emergency loans \u201cas soon as is practicable.\u201d To some banking specialists, the delay suggests the Fed is stalling because it values the need to act freely in times of crisis.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe Fed might be thinking, \u2018We don\u2019t want to make a lot of rules that might hinder us from acting in an emergency situation that we can\u2019t anticipate,\u2019\xa0\u201d said Michael Bradfield, a former general counsel at the Fed.        ', u'\n                    When asked, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the Fed, did not say when the new rules would be completed.        ', u'\n                    Even without freshly written rules from the Fed, the Dodd-Frank legislation immediately introduced measures to make the central bank more accountable. For example, the Fed must now file regular and detailed reports to Congress if it undertakes any emergency lending.        ', u'\n                    Still, the overhaul went much further to set conditions on Fed loans during a crisis, and it is these measures that the central bank has yet to complete.        ', u'\n                    It has to have policies in place to prevent losses on emergency loans. For instance, the assets pledged to the Fed in return for the loans would have to be sufficient to absorb losses should the borrower default.        ', u'\n                    In an interesting twist, Congress also requested that when a bank participates in an emergency loan, its chief executive must certify that the bank is not insolvent at the time. The Fed would need to set out procedures for doing that.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI think the Fed should have reasonably broad discretion to deal with systemic issues,\u201d Mr. Bradfield said. \u201cBut then the question is, What\u2019s systemic and what\u2019s really needed, and what conditions ought to accompany that lending?\u201d        ', u'\n                    A person familiar with the Fed\u2019s thinking says any future emergency lending would still be bound by the demands of Dodd-Frank, even if the Fed has not issued rules by then. The central bank would still be obliged by the law to take careful steps to avoid losses, for instance.        ', u'\n                    Some banking analysts agree. \u201cIf something suddenly came up, they would make decisions based on Dodd-Frank, even if they had not previously published rules about how they would do this,\u201d said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the ', u'.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Elliott also says the Fed may be focusing on writing other important rules stemming from Dodd-Frank. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable that they have not given a priority instead to a rule about a hypothetical future crisis,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Still, unlike other rules, whose writing requires cooperation with several other agencies, the Fed can complete these itself after consulting with the ', u'. In addition, these emergency lending guidelines are likely to be far less complicated than regulations like the ', u', which aims to define the types of trading that banks are allowed to do.        ', u'\n                    Senior Fed officials have already been voicing concern about aspects of the financial system that were shored up by crisis loans. For example, Daniel K. Tarullo, the Fed governor who oversees regulation, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV last week that he was still concerned about \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks borrowing in credit markets \u201cthat are subject to runs and liquidity freezes.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Also last week, another Fed governor, Jeremy C. Stein, gave a speech that recognized one of the risks involved in the Fed\u2019s emergency lending programs. He spoke about moral hazard, the belief that government support can subsidize banks and make them less careful about the dangers inherent in their businesses.        ', u'\n                    One way to help address the moral hazard problem would be for the Fed to come out with the new rules on emergency lending. Depending on how strict the rules are, the banks might then realize that the Fed will not be a pushover in times of market stress.        ', u'\n                    But the Fed may find it hard to formulate rules that allow it to stem market panics without bailing out undeserving institutions.        ', u'\n                    \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put out rules that make you look vacuous and you don\u2019t want to put out rules that tie your hands,\u201d Mr. Bradfield said.        ', u'\n                    But whenever the rules appear, the Fed will face political scrutiny on such a contentious subject. \u201cNo rule about potential assistance from the Fed is going to be easy under the highly politicized conditions that exist today, with everything they do subject to criticism, especially if it helps financial institutions,\u201d Mr. Elliott said.

', u'\n                    Anheuser-Busch InBev is itself the result of a $52 billion merger in 2008 between the maker of Budweiser and a Belgian-Brazilian brewer.

Few imports to Europe, analysts say, have a greater potential for growth there.        ', u'\n                    But the Justice Department decided that in the United States, joining the marketing of Corona with that of Bud Light, the country\u2019s biggest seller, and other top brands would result in too much consolidation and too little price competition.

So it\u2019s no surprise that I\u2019m getting this question a lot: Do I need to invest in exchange-traded funds?        ', u'\n                    The fact that lots of people are confused about ', u' \u2014 they\u2019re essentially index funds that trade on an exchange like stocks \u2014 and why investors might want them is no surprise. To add to the confusion, last week ', u' it was planning to design and offer its own E.T.F.\u2019s. Seriously? Their announcement about the benefits of E.T.F.\u2019s offers a great example of why people are so confused.        ', u'\n                    Here are some of the advantages CNBC cited:        ', u'\n                    1) E.T.F.\u2019s offer diversification.        ', u'\n                    Sure they do, but this is nothing new or unique to exchange-traded funds. Traditional mutual funds were invented to offer diversification. Sure, you can now trade an E.T.F. that ', u'. There\u2019s also an\xa0E.T.F. for those \u201clong-term investors\u201d who want exposure to the inverse price of silver with a whole bunch of leverage. Is this what we\u2019re talking about when we say E.T.F.\u2019s offer diversification?\xa0In fact, there are more mutual funds to choose from than the number of stocks listed on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange combined.        ', u'\n                    2) E.T.F.\u2019s are low cost.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s true that some E.T.F.\u2019s are an additional, low-cost alternative to index funds. Plus, you might be able to argue that the added competition from exchange-traded funds has driven down the cost of mutual funds. Remember, however, that there are also some very expensive E.T.F.\u2019s and some extremely cheap mutual funds.        ', u'\n                    3) E.T.F.\u2019s allow intraday trading.        ', u'\n                    Stop and think about that one for a minute. If you\u2019re investing for the long term, why do you care if you can trade your investment every hour, minute and second of the day? The benefit of intraday trading only matters if you\u2019re an active trader. And if you are, E.T.F.\u2019s will just let you cut your own fingers off that much faster.        ', u'\n                    4) E.T.F.\u2019s allow your adviser to place you in the right fund at the right time.        ', u'\n                    This is code for something that virtually no one can successfully do: time the market. Claiming that exchange-traded funds allow an adviser to add value by placing a client in the right fund at the right time is not only wrong, it\u2019s dangerous. Any adviser who claims to be able to time the market is an adviser you should run from. Advisers are valuable if they can help you avoid the costly behavioral mistakes we all tend to make, not because they claim to be able to outperform the market.        ', u'\n                    All the hype about E.T.F.\u2019s is just throwing more fuel on the behavioral fire (see intraday trading, market timing). Ultimately, E.T.F.\u2019s are just another tool that should be evaluated alongside all of the other tools available to help you reach your goals. To be clear, I\u2019m not saying that all E.T.F.\u2019s are bad. What I am saying is E.T.F.\u2019s alone won\u2019t solve our most vexing investing problem: our own behavior. In fact, they might just make it easier to behave badly.        ', u'\n                    For most long-term investors, exchange-traded funds don\u2019t offer significantly different benefits over other low-cost funds. So my answer to the E.T.F. question is pretty simple: just because everyone else is doing it, doesn\u2019t mean you should.

Most recently, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator ', u', Republican of Louisiana, said that they planned to introduce a bill that would require banks to hold considerably more capital. If passed, such a requirement is likely to prompt the largest banks to shrink in size. While a draft of the legislation does not stipulate a maximum size for banks, it requires financial firms with more than $400 billion of assets to hold additional capital.

Helped by Wall Street financial firms, American companies have raised huge amounts in capital markets since the crisis. Last year, corporations issued $940 billion of bonds, a record amount, according to Dealogic, a data provider. This has happened even as investment banks scaled back their operations to get ready for regulations they vocally oppose, like the so-called ', u'.

Citigroup, which was subject to much regulatory pressure, is more streamlined and reported strong first-quarter earnings this week.

', u'\n                    Mr. Bove says that, while bank profits have hardly suffered from new regulation, their customers have. Lenders have simply passed on many of the costs, mostly in the form of new fees, he said. \u201cThe government aimed a Stinger missile at the banking industry and missed and hit the consumer instead,\u201d said Mr. Bove, who also notes that loans to small business are still weak.        ', u'\n                    In addition, bank profits may not be as strong as they look, say some analysts. Earnings appear less impressive when taking into account the new capital that banks have to hold. This can be seen when applying a metric called return on equity, which reflects the extra capital.        ', u'\n                    Financial companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had a 7.9 percent return on equity last year, according to data from S.& P. That\u2019s below the 10 percent return for utilities last year, also a regulated industry. And the banks\u2019 return is down from the 16 percent return that they achieved in 2006.        ', u'\n                    That is why some analysts argue that it would be a mistake to force banks to hold even more capital than they already will under Dodd-Frank and Basel III. They argue that it would depress returns on equity and therefore prompt banks to exit certain businesses, reducing credit in the economy. In a research note last week, a ', u' bank analyst estimated a Brown-Vitter bill could remove $3.8 trillion of credit from the United States banking system.

This shows that profit margins in the new mortgage business have fallen as Bank of America has increased its activity.

', u'\n                    Its initial public offering got off to a strong start Tuesday evening, with Fairway pricing its shares at $13 each, above the expected range, according to a person briefed on the matter. It raised $177.5 million, valuing the whole company at $536.1 million.        ', u'\n                    Fairway\u2019s tag line claims that it is \u201clike no other market,\u201d yet it is seeking to expand in a hypercompetitive industry.

With Sterling\u2019s support, Fairway expanded in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and is making plans to open stores at a rate of three to four a year.        ', u'\n                    But with the expansion has come fresh risks. The company lost $11.9 million in the fiscal year that ended in April 2012, even as sales increased 14 percent, to $554.9 million. Its debt has grown, reaching $203.6 million as of last April.

Five feet of water washed through the store, destroying its inventory and damaging equipment.        ', u'\n                    Fairway had recently filed to go public. But with the Red Hook store closed, the company lost out on what might have been $12.7 million in sales, judging by results in the period a year earlier. The store reopened at the beginning of March with a celebration attended by Mayor ', u'.        ', u'\n                    For decades, Fairway was a family business, beginning in the 1930s as a fruit and vegetable stand run by Nathan Glickberg. Originally known as 74th Street Market, the store expanded in 1954, adding meat, cheese and dairy products, and adopted its current name in an effort to reflect its fair prices.

', u'\n                    Philip Lempert, the editor of Supermarket Guru, an online food-industry publication, said that Fairway would face challenges in the transformation from a local chain to a national one.

Pekelner, who on Tuesday spent about $3 on a half-gallon of milk, an onion and two plum tomatoes. \u201cI just needed some fill-in items for a salad,\u201d he said.

But as competition has popped up in the neighborhood, he has found himself frequenting other stores, like Trader Joe\u2019s, which opened just a few blocks down Broadway in 2010.        ', u'\n                    By the water in Red Hook, Fairway has a different character, with wide aisles that, compared with the original store, seem downright palatial.

', u'\n                    The S.E.C. has traditionally permitted defendants to settle regulatory actions by paying a fine while not admitting liability, arguing that the practice is efficient and less costly than taking deep-pocketed financial firms to court and risking losing the case.        ', u'\n                    Much of Judge Marrero\u2019s 34-page opinion centered on the \u201cneither admit nor deny wrongdoing\u201d language contained in the SAC settlement and many other settlements struck by the S.E.C. In recent months, federal judges across the country have followed Judge Rakoff\u2019s lead and suggested that the S.E.C. and other government agencies were letting defendants off lightly by not forcing them to acknowledge wrongdoing.        ', u'\n                    Judge Marrero indicated that the \u201cneither admit nor deny\u201d boilerplate had no place in a post-financial-crisis world.

The case related to the conduct of a former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma, who was charged in November with illegal trading in two pharmaceutical stocks and helping SAC make $276 million in illicit profits and avoid losses. Mr. Martoma has denied the charges.        ', u'\n                    Last month, Judge ', u' approved a separate S.E.C. insider trading case against SAC, signing off on a $14 million settlement that resolved accusations that the firm\u2019s Sigma Capital unit had illegally traded in shares of technology. As part of that agreement, SAC neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Judge Baer raised no issues with the deal.

Cohen, has emerged as a focus of the government\u2019s multiyear investigation into insider trading at hedge funds. The two civil matters \u2014 the $602 million case and the $14 million one \u2014 are the only legal actions against SAC, but the government has brought criminal insider trading charges against several of its former employees, including four who have pleaded guilty.        ', u'\n                    Representatives of the S.E.C. and SAC declined to comment on the judge\u2019s ruling. Mr. Cohen has not been accused of any wrongdoing.        ', u'\n                    Judge Marrero laid out a court\u2019s balancing act in weighing the approval of settlements struck by government agencies that do not force a defendant to admit liability.

On page after page, Judge Marrero used strong language \u2014 and lengthy sentences \u2014 to convey his discomfort with the S.E.C.\u2019s policy. In one part of the opinion, he said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the practice; a paragraph later, he expressed \u201cmisgivings\u201d about it.

', u'\n                    To begin, developers cannot sell ads in apps, collect user data for ads, share data with ad companies or distribute apps elsewhere. They cannot charge people to buy apps or virtual goods or services within them.

The apps, which will be called Glassware, will be cloud-based, like Web apps, as opposed to living on the device like cellphone apps. Developers will not be able to change the display or access the sensors on the device.

The department had been the source of trading losses, and Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief executive, James P. Gorman, has been trying to shift the bank out of riskier businesses to less volatile areas like wealth management.        ', u'\n                    Richard Bove, an analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets, said that Morgan Stanley\u2019s decision to shrink the fixed-income business meant that not only was it losing talented traders, it was not attracting as many as it used to. As a result, it will be hard for Morgan Stanley to keep up with competitors.        ', u'\n                    \u201cMost investors are unhappy with the fact this company was not able to grow its trading activity as much as its peers and as a result they perceive there is a significant problem at the company and are pulling away from the stock,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said she was surprised by the severity of Thursday\u2019s stock drop.        ', u'\n                    She said while there was certainly room for improvement in the earnings, investors needed to keep in mind that the bank had a strong first quarter in 2012, so that in comparison the decline in trading revenue appeared worse than it really was.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI am not saying $1.5 billion is as good as it can be, but we are continuing that steady progress we have always talk about,\u201d Ms. Porat said, noting the bank had strong sequential revenue growth over the last year and continued to sell risky assets.        ', u'\n                    Morgan Stanley earned a profit, adjusted for accounting charges, of $1 billion, or 50 cents a share. That compares with a loss of $79 million in the period a year earlier. The one-time charges were related to the bank\u2019s credit spreads. Excluding the charges, the bank had a profit of $1.2 billion, or 61 cents a share, a decline from the $1.4 billion reported in the first quarter of 2012.        ', u'\n                    Morgan Stanley\u2019s adjusted revenue for the three months ended March 31 fell to $8.5 billion, from $8.9 billion in the period a year earlier. Analysts forecast revenue of $8.35 billion.        ', u'\n                    Return on equity, a measure of how efficiently shareholder money is being deployed, fell to 7.6 percent from 9.2 percent in the year-ago period        ', u'\n                    Excluding charges related to the bank\u2019s credit spreads, known as debt valuation adjustments, net revenue in institutional securities, which houses the fixed-income department, was $4.4 billion, compared with $5.1 billion in the period a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    Revenue from trading commodities and rates fell in the quarter. The decline in revenue from trading interest rates came despite a decision to take more risk over the last year. In rates and credit spreads, the bank\u2019s quarterly value at risk \u2014 a yardstick of how much could be lost in one trading day \u2014 was $61 million, up from $46 million in the year-ago period.        ', u'\n                    The bright spot in Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings was its wealth management division, led by Gregory Fleming. It posted pretax income from continuing operations of $597 million, up 48 percent from the $403 million reported in the first quarter of last year.        ', u'\n                    One number investors were watching, the division\u2019s pretax profit margin, came in at 17 percent, higher than some analysts had projected. Net revenue in wealth management rose to $3.5 billion from $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2012.

Supposedly, all of this will drive a self-sustaining economic recovery.        ', u'\n                    Instead, the Fed has kindled speculation. Investors are desperate for yield and are paying up for riskier assets. In areas like real estate, structured finance and equities, the markets are ahead of the fundamentals.

But that\u2019s misleading. Corporate earnings are extremely high as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Margins are high. Is that sustainable?        ', u'\n                    There are more reliable measures of stock market value, and they look frothy. One gauge, the price of stocks based on the past decade of earnings, is named after the Yale economist ', u'. Using that, stocks are too expensive by 65 percent. Alternatively, many investors look at something called the Q, devised by the economist James Tobin, which compares stock prices with corporate net worth. The nonfinancial companies are overpriced by 57 percent. The stock market is not at 1999 or 1929 levels, but it has reached other previous peaks of 1906, 1936 and 1968, according to Smithers & Company, a London-based research shop.

He expects earnings to fall.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s not just stocks. Investors are bidding up junk bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and bundles of corporate loans called collateralized loan obligations. Last month, investors ', u'for such loans than at any time in the last five years. They are ', u' made up of subprime ', u'.        ', u'\n                    And the housing market isn\u2019t just rising, but roaring back so fast you can feel the G-force coming off the reports. Home prices in Phoenix went up 23 percent over the last year, according to the latest Standard & Poor\u2019s Case-Shiller index. More than one in four homes in Phoenix was purchased by an investor who bought more than five homes, up from 16 percent a year earlier.

And when there is oversupply of capacity, the wealthy don\u2019t need to invest in new capacity.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Has the Federal Reserve monetary policy reached the average American? To a certain degree, yes. Many Americans have been able to refinance their homes. Those auto loans may be helping people get to and from work.        ', u'\n                    But the economic effects are modest for the size and scope of the effort. Investors glory in the asset inflation. The most pronounced effect of low mortgage rates has been to allow people with good credit and low debt to refinance multiple times over the last few years. Stock ownership is concentrated among the wealthy; junk bonds and collateralized loan obligations only more so.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Alpert says the first round of quantitative easing was necessary to ease the liquidity problem in the markets \u2014 the unwillingness of investors to conquer their fears and buy up assets. But the third round is \u201cunnecessary,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Others disagree. Dean Baker, an economist from the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who warned about the housing bubble much earlier than most, doesn\u2019t see a bubble yet. He advocates continuing quantitative easing.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Baker adds a note of caution, however.

', u'\n                    The price of the metal has been undergoing an extraordinary reversal from a decade-long rally. Since reaching a high of $1,888 an ounce in August 2011, gold has been on a downward slope. The decline picked up pace on Friday, when gold fell 4 percent, officially taking it into a bear market, which is defined as a 20 percent drop from its recent high.        ', u'\n                    The damage worsened on Monday, when the price of an ounce of gold dropped 9.35 percent, or $140.40, to $1,360.60 for the April contract \u2014 the sharpest such one-day decline since February of 1983.

', u'\n                    The assumption among gold bugs was that the flood of new money would cause inflation, making hard assets like gold more attractive. So far, though, there have been few signs of inflation taking root even as central banks in Japan and Europe have begun their own aggressive bond-buying programs.        ', u'\n                    \u201cGold has had all the reason in the world to be moving higher \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t been able to do it,\u201d said Matt Zeman, a metals trader at Kingsview Financial. \u201cThe situation has not deteriorated the way that a lot of people thought it could.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The recent drop in gold prices has been partly attributed to signals from powerful members of the Fed that the central bank may begin to wind down its bond-buying programs. But the list of reasons to sell gold grows longer by the day. European politicians have indicated that Cyprus may need to sell off some of its gold holdings to pay for its bank bailout, which could lead other countries to do the same.        ', u'\n                    The market decline, like the decade-long run-up, has also been attributed to the new financial instruments that have made buying gold easier for a wide array of investors. The most prominent products are gold ', u', which can be traded on stock exchanges, and which together hold as much gold as all but a few of the world\u2019s largest central banks.

But this has not been enough to prop up the market.

Ullman III, reinstalled as chief executive last week, now has to show how he\u2019s going to win it.        ', u'\n                    His first big move occurred on Monday, when J. C. Penney said in a statement that it had borrowed $850 million from a credit line that makes a total of $1.85 billion available to the company.        ', u'\n                    For all its woes, the retailer\u2019s operations have until recently produced reasonably robust cash flows. And at the start of February, the company had a little more than $900 million of cash in hand.        ', u'\n                    Therefore, the decision to tap its loan now, rather than wait until the company\u2019s cash use spikes later in the year, suggests that Penney\u2019s year has had a particularly bad start. Customers have not responded well to brash changes instituted by Ron Johnson, the previous chief executive. Sales have been slumping for months.        ', u'\n                    And another piece of news in Monday\u2019s statement could deepen the cash concerns. The company said that in addition to tapping its credit line, it was looking into other ways of raising money.        ', u'\n                    Though these may seem like desperate moves, there are good reasons to undertake these measures: Penney\u2019s executives are wisely taking pre-emptive steps to avert the sort of panic that has felled many a retailer.        ', u'\n                    When a department store faces financial problems, suppliers get nervous and demand to be paid for their goods much more quickly \u2014 or even up front.        ', u'\n                    This can reduce cash balances at the retailer, in turn prompting suppliers to demand even stiffer payment terms. Eventually the spiral can lead to bankruptcy. Witness what happened to Circuit City, which collapsed four and a half years ago.        ', u'\n                    It doesn\u2019t have to end like that, though. There are instances of retailers taking actions to buy time and quelling the nerves of suppliers in the process. One example is ', u', which last year avoided an aggressive squeeze by suppliers even though its operations were still faltering.        ', u'\n                    Fighting panic often has a psychological element, something Penney\u2019s board and major shareholders appear to grasp. A desire to pacify suppliers, often referred to in the industry as vendors, may also have been behind the departure of Mr. Johnson.        ', u'\n                    \u201cKeeping the vendors happy is key for the company at this point, and that seemed to be a driving factor in the C.E.O. decision,\u201d said James Goldstein, a senior credit analyst at CreditSights.        ', u'\n                    (Penney did not respond to requests for comment for this article.)        ', u'\n                    Dispelling fears is also a numbers game.        ', u'\n                    Having drawn down part of the credit line, Penney has an extra $850 million in the bank, at least for now. If it raised an additional $1 billion from other sources, suppliers might breathe more easily, and the retailer might never need to spend any of the new money.        ', u'\n                    If the company does try other methods to raise new cash, much depends on how it goes about it. One way is just to sell new shares, which might hurt the already pulverized stock price. But an infusion of new equity could strengthen the balance sheet, since it wouldn\u2019t add to the company\u2019s debt levels.        ', u'\n                    However, selling a large amount of new stock may be tough, given the pain the stock decline has caused, says Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit.        ', u'\n                    \u201cLet\u2019s face it, two major investment firms have already held minority stakes for some time \u2014 Vornado and Pershing Square \u2014 and both have lived to regret it,\u201d Ms. Levenson said in an e-mail. \u201cDoes anybody have ', u'\u2019s number?\u201d ', u' is a public company that owns and manages commercial buildings. Pershing Square is a hedge fund run by William A. Ackman.        ', u'\n                    Penney could try to raise new cash by selling debt. In that case, it would be intriguing to see what it provides as collateral to the new creditors. On paper, banks already have the right to some assets, like inventory. One option would be to use some of the company\u2019s buildings as collateral. Analysts at ', u' estimate that the retailer\u2019s owned real estate is worth about $2.5 billion.        ', u'\n                    There is also a lot of skepticism about how much value can be wrung out of stores owned by struggling retailers. In recent weeks, some analysts said that Penney could spin off a separate company that would then lease its unused buildings.        ', u'\n                    But Ms. Levenson says she isn\u2019t convinced by such theories. \u201cDon\u2019t you think if there was something smart to do with Penney\u2019s real estate, Vornado would have thought of it during the past couple of years?\u201d she said.        ', u'\n                    Just about everyone in the retail industry will now be parsing Penney\u2019s quarterly free cash flows, a measurement that looks at how much cash the company\u2019s operations generated after taking into account expenditures on things like new store fittings.        ', u'\n                    In its latest financial year, which ended in early February, the company had negative free cash flows of $820 million. In the previous year, it had positive free cash flows of nearly $200 million.        ', u'\n                    But vendors, shareholders and creditors will also want Mr. Ullman to start detailing how he will try to create concrete improvements in Penney\u2019s actual operations. That task is made especially hard by the fact that the company is in the middle of a transformation that may not work.        ', u'\n                    Therefore, Mr. Ullman has to communicate how far he will go in unwinding Mr. Johnson\u2019s initiatives and reimposing his own. Some of Mr. Johnson\u2019s changes may benefit the company, but putting them in place can also eat up a lot of cash. And Mr. Ullman\u2019s methods may not be enough.        ', u'\n                    Ms. Levenson says she believes Penney has some time.

And while some may hope that this will change public companies for the better, we may instead end up with something resembling trench warfare.\n        ', u'\n                    \nWhat is clear is that shareholder activism is reaching further into corporate America. The proxy advisory service Institutional Shareholder Services is projecting that there could be as many as 17 contests for the election of directors.        ', u'\n                    This is only a slight uptick from last year, but the difference is that the contests are much bigger this time around and include six at companies with a market value of more than $1 billion. Last year, the only billion-dollar company to have a contested election was the ', u', which successfully thwarted an effort by the activist investor ', u' to get directors on the board.        ', u'\n                    Already this year, two billion-dollar companies have held contested elections: TPG-Axon Capital Management\u2019s effort to remove the entire board at the oil and gas explorer SandRidge Energy, and the Ader Group\u2019s effort to elect three directors at ', u', a manufacturer of gambling machines. At SandRidge, a settlement with activist investors led to four nominees of the hedge fund being put on the board and an agreement for the departure of the chief executive. In the case of International Game, one independent director was elected.        ', u'\n                    These victories illustrate that activists win more often than not in board elections. So far this year, according to the data provider FactSet SharkRepellent, 66 percent of contests have been successful for the activists. This is up from 51 percent last year, though we are still early in the season.        ', u'\n                    Activists owe part of their success to I.S.S. and a rival, Glass, Lewis & Company. I.S.S. in particular is followed by many mutual funds and other institutional investors, and studies have found that it can sway up to 10 percent of the vote and much more in highly public elections. And it often recommends in favor of the dissidents. Last year, it recommended in favor of the dissidents in 52 percent of campaigns. So far this year, that number is up to 73 percent. This is not completely surprising because the companies that are targets for activists are typically poor performers or in need of change.        ', u'\n                    This year, the activists are leveraging this advantage to supersize their contests. Elliott Management is taking aim at the $23 billion ', u', an energy company that Elliott contends has underperformed the market by more than 460 percent over the last 17 years while paying its management and directors $540 million.        ', u'\n                    Hess has responded the way many other companies now do when faced with an activist: try to change. The company has replaced directors wholesale and disclosed that it is ', u' to dispose of assets and focus on exploration and production. Elliott is unimpressed and is pursuing its contest.        ', u'\n                    Not even big companies are immune to proxy activism. But as activists aim at bigger targets, they are adapting their strategies. A popular tactic in years past has been to argue for spinoffs of a company\u2019s low-growth businesses. Now, the goals can be much more varied. David Einhorn, for example, has sought to make an issue of Apple\u2019s enormous cash pile. Then there is the increasingly prominent opposition activism in mergers that we are seeing with Dell and its shareholder revolt, led by Southeastern Asset Management.        ', u'\n                    There are also campaigns to separate the job of chairman of the board from the chief executive, like the proposal at ', u'. In all, Alliance Advisors is predicting more than 600 proposals for ', u' this year, like separating the chairman and chief executive roles and changing corporate political spending.        ', u'\n                    Success is bringing new entrants. The California teachers\u2019 pension fund has joined forces with the investment firm Relational Investors to campaign for the breakup of the ', u' into steel and bearing businesses.        ', u'\n                    Former employees of star activists are forming their own funds. The heated battle to replace the board at Commonwealth REIT is being led by a former Icahn disciple, Keith Meister, and Corvex Management, while Mick McGuire of Marcato Capital Management, who recently won a seat on the board of the ', u', is from William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square. There is even a project affiliated with Harvard Law School to bring proposals to force boards to have annual instead of staggered elections.        ', u'\n                    The surge in shareholder activism is not all puppies and rainbows, however. There are questions about whether these changes push companies to focus on the short term or are too distracting from the real business of running these companies. And of course, there is always the question whether boards or shareholders are better situated to decide the future of the company.        ', u'\n                    Many companies are getting prepared for the activists and are ready to fight back.        ', u'\n                    They are doing so in two ways. First, companies are adopting provisions to fend off the activists. Long and convoluted notice periods are now commonplace, and many companies are adopting shareholders rights plans, or poison pills, with low thresholds, effectively limiting the number of shares an activist can acquire to 5 to 10 percent of a company.        ', u'\n                    And not surprisingly, companies are trying to regulate this type of activism out of business. The ', u' is preparing to announce rules for the regulation of proxy advisers, and corporate America is lobbying to try to diminish the influence of I.S.S. through these rules. Companies and their representatives are also trying to get regulators to increase the disclosure requirements for activists.        ', u'\n                    This may be only a start. In the 1980s, when corporate America was under attack from hostile raiders, companies pushed hard to get legislatures to adopt anti-takeover measures and to validate poison pills. They succeeded. As activism becomes more commonplace, expect the companies to push back harder by looking for a way to avoid these attacks.        ', u'\n                    In other words, don\u2019t expect corporate America to fold quietly. Instead, the battle is more likely to spread to regulators and legislators as companies take a proactive stance in anticipation of shareholder activism. But if anything, that activism is here to stay. It all means that the battle between shareholders and companies is likely to get only worse in coming years as the barbarians at the gate become ever more bolder and innovative.

One challenge: the United States consumer.        ', u'\n                    Borrowers are still unwilling to take on new loans, even with interest rates hovering at near-record lows.

Ms. Sanyour, a television producer who lives in Des Moines, said she had devoted an entire paycheck this month to wiping out her debt on a Citigroup credit card.

Such a tepid appetite for loans underpinned Citigroup\u2019s results on Monday. While total loans inched up slightly in the first quarter to $539 billion, the bulk of the growth stemmed from demand among corporate clients beyond the United States. Consumer lending rose just 1 percent in the first quarter. In North America, revenue in the global banking unit stagnated, falling by 1 percent to $5.1 billion.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe environment remains challenging and we are sure to be tested as we go through the year,\u201d ', u', the bank\u2019s chief executive, said in the earnings release.        ', u'\n                    Citigroup\u2019s quarterly earnings underscore broader challenges buffeting the United States banking industry. On Friday, ', u' and ', u' reported declines in revenue, slowed in part by mortgage machines that are beginning to sputter. The refinancing boom, fed by federal largess that drove down interest rates and spurred a flurry of refinancings, is showing signs of petering out.        ', u'\n                    Combined with Citi\u2019s earnings Monday, the results are propelling worries that banks are floundering to offset income sapped by a spate of new financial regulations and a lackluster economy. Sluggish loan demand is renewing those concerns.

', u'\n                    Beyond the banking results, other indicators of economic health have proved dispiriting as well. Retail sales in the United States fell by 0.4 percent in March. Even though unemployment is falling, consumers remain unconvinced.        ', u'\n                    Part of the wariness among consumers, banking analysts say, arises from broad skepticism about the housing market. Even though housing prices have been rising recently, the improvements won\u2019t rouse consumers until they remain steadily high for a longer stretch, according to analysts. \u201cIf housing prices start to stall even a little bit, then we are going to see an even greater retreat from consumers,\u201d said J. J. Kinahan, a strategist at ', u'.

', u'\n                    Citigroup has pinned some of its hope for future profitability on its vast international footprint, but some regions produced lackluster returns. Revenue from consumer banking in Asia fell in the first quarter to $2 billion, down 1 percent from the same period a year earlier. The bank is struggling to navigate the shifting regulatory landscape in Asia. In South Korea, for example, national officials placed a cap on the interest rates of a range of consumer loans. Mr. Gerspach said that there were \u201cstill headwinds\u201d in the region.        ', u'\n                    Despite the challenges, Citigroup showed strengths in other parts of its business. A bright spot in the first quarter was the securities and banking group, which was bolstered by strong gains in investment banking, fixed income and equities.        ', u'\n                    Revenue in that unit surged 31 percent, to $6.98 billion, while net income was $2.3 billion, up 81 percent from the period a year earlier. For Citigroup, the unit has been a consistent focus. Mr. Gerspach reiterated that on Monday, saying the bank continued to make \u201csteady progress\u201d in its share of a \u201cclient\u2019s wallet.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Much of the gains in securities and banking came from Citigroup\u2019s investment banking unit, which was buoyed by increases in debt and equity underwriting. The unit\u2019s revenue increased to $1.1 billion, up 22 percent from the period a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    Over all, investors seemed pleased with the quarterly results. Citigroup\u2019s stock rose 9 cents to $44.87 on Monday, after trading in the morning above $46, on a day when there was wide selling in the stock market.        ', u'\n                    The quarterly report is the second under the leadership of Mr. Corbat, who took over after the abrupt ouster of ', u'. In October, Michael E.

', u'\n                    Mr. Corbat has vowed to continue reorienting the bank toward its core business while shedding less-profitable units. That cost-cutting began under Mr. Pandit, who helped return the bank to profitability after presiding over a turbulent chapter in its history when Citi received a $45 billion federal lifeline.        ', u'\n                    Citigroup has been aggressively whittling down a morass of soured loans and cutting less-profitable business lines to reduce costs.

Last month, it agreed to pay $730 million to settle claims that it had persuaded investors to buy securities backed by shaky mortgage loans. The bank did not admit any wrongdoing.

', u'\n                    Since the financial crisis, Goldman has largely defied critics who predicted the death of its business model. Those calls were hardly surprising. Goldman and its competitors are operating with less borrowed money, which has drastically reduced profitability, and the billions that Goldman made packaging and selling securities from mortgages has all but disappeared. New regulations aimed at curbing the risk-taking that led to the financial crisis have further eaten into profits.        ', u'\n                    The company has also suffered a number of blows to its reputation, including accusations by the ', u' that it defrauded its clients.        ', u'\n                    Yet the resilience of Goldman was amply demonstrated on Tuesday, as the company reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations.        ', u'\n                    Results were driven by strength in its investment banking business as well as its investing and lending operations. Goldman reported a first-quarter profit of $2.2 billion, up 5 percent from the same period a year ago.        ', u'\n                    The results also underscored the challenges \u2014 regulatory and otherwise \u2014 facing the bank.        ', u'\n                    Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura, said that while the company\u2019s earnings were good, roughly $2 billion in revenue came from investments that tended to fluctuate in value, which is troublesome to some investors. Shares of Goldman fell on Tuesday, closing down 1.6 percent, at $144.10.        ', u'\n                    \u201cOn a relative basis Goldman is doing well, but there is still a lot of uncertainly facing Goldman and its rivals,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    Relative may be the operative word. Goldman has benefited in part from the misfortunes of others. While all banks are under pressure to cut employees and compensation, the competitive landscape is shrinking.        ', u'\n                    \u201cAll this should translate into more profits for the banks that survive,\u201d Mr. Schorr added.        ', u'\n                    After ', u' failed in 2008 and JPMorgan Chase bought ', u', Goldman picked up market share from these two companies.        ', u'\n                    Since the financial crisis, new regulations have made it more expensive for banks to stay in fixed income, and companies like ', u', ', u' and ', u' have shrunk their operations as a result. Goldman, which was less damaged by the financial crisis than some of its competitors, made a decision early on in the wake of the crisis not to pull out of fixed income, which now provides a diminished but still significant portion of Goldman\u2019s revenue.        ', u'\n                    Europe\u2019s debt crisis has meant that bonds have been replacing bank loans in corporate finance on the Continent, and Goldman has been a major player in this shift. The bank has also picked up market share in other businesses like trading and in creating securities like equity derivatives, an area that had previously been dominated by European banks.        ', u'\n                    Goldman has also expanded into debt underwriting, a corner of Wall Street normally dominated by rivals like ', u' and JPMorgan. In the first quarter, Goldman had revenue of $694 million in this area, a record.        ', u'\n                    Even as it has picked up market share, however, Goldman faces the same harsh markets and regulatory burdens as its rivals. The financial regulatory overhaul in the United States is forcing Goldman and others out of lucrative businesses like proprietary trading, where banks make directional bets on the market with their own money. And American banks will soon be operating under tougher capital requirements already being met by many European banks, something that could further crimp profits.        ', u'\n                    To offset slowing revenue growth, Goldman, like other banks, has been cutting costs and people.        ', u'\n                    There is one significant change in personnel the company hasn\u2019t made, however. Goldman has stuck by its chief executive, ', u', who was largely viewed as a liability during the financial crisis. Some shareholders say he has provided stable leadership at a time when top ranks are changing at other banks.        ', u'\n                    After seven years at the helm, Mr. Blankfein, 58, is now one of the longest-serving chief executives on Wall Street, raising questions about when he might retire.        ', u'\n                    His most likely successor is Mr. Cohn, the Goldman president, who as a former metals trader is cut from the same cloth as his longtime friend Mr. Blankfein, suggesting the company would not change gears should Mr. Cohn take over in the coming years.        ', u'\n                    But the core business unit that has produced many of Goldman\u2019s leaders and has helped define its culture \u2014 the powerful division that trades bonds, currencies and commodities \u2014 produced lower year-over-year results for the first three months of the year. Net revenue for the division fell 7 percent, to $3.2 billion, from the period a year earlier. The bank said the decline primarily reflected \u201csignificantly lower net revenues in interest rate products compared with a strong first quarter of 2012.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Goldman\u2019s investment banking division, however, weighed in with strong results, as revenue increased 36 percent, to $1.57 billion. This division benefited from the record debt underwriting results, and Goldman said that revenue in equity underwriting was also \u201csignificantly higher compared with the first quarter of 2012, reflecting an increase in client activity.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The company\u2019s investing and lending segment also did well, posting revenue of $2.07 billion, up 8 percent from the period in 2012. Goldman said this unit benefited from an increase in equity prices and a $24 million gain from the company\u2019s stake in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a strategic investment Goldman made in 2006.        ', u'\n                    The company\u2019s own sense of uncertainty is evident in how it sees its target return on equity \u2014 a vital metric on Wall Street, measuring how efficiently shareholder money is being deployed.

', u'\n                    The controversy stems from a ', u' by economists at the ', u', Amherst that claims to have found some basic errors in one of the most pathbreaking and influential economic studies to come out in the last few years.        ', u'\n                    That was a 2010 ', u' by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard, also authors of a best seller, \u201cThis Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.\u201d The economists, analyzing 3,700 separate economic observations, found little relationship between growth and debt for countries with debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios of 90 percent or less. But for countries with debt loads equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output, \u201cmedian growth rates fall by 1 percent, and average growth falls considerably more.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Many politicians interpreted the research as showing a direct relationship between debt and growth. If a country reached a debt burden of more than 90 percent of its annual economic output, the logic went, it would quickly fall into a debt trap that would leave it struggling to grow in the coming years. Prominent politicians \u2014 including Olli Rehn of the ', u' and Representative ', u', the chairman of the House Budget Committee \u2014 cited it as a reason to try to impose major budget cuts.        ', u'\n                    The Harvard economists\u2019 research was always more nuanced about the causal relationship between debt and growth than the popular view. Some economists expressed skepticism of the \u201cthreshold\u201d theory to begin with. And many others noted how hard it could be to draw straight lines between debt and economic growth, given the panoply of factors at work.        ', u'\n                    But now, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in trying to replicate the Reinhart-Rogoff results, are challenging the conclusions for a different reason. They say they found some simple miscalculations or data exclusions that sharply altered the ultimate results. According to their rerunning of the figures, \u201cthe average real G.D.P. growth rate for countries carrying a public debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not \u20130.1 percent,\u201d they write. In other words, heavy debts were not associated with the malaise that Professors Reinhart and Rogoff \u2014 and much of the world\u2019s economic elite \u2014 thought that they were.        ', u'\n                    The new paper, released this week, has set off a storm within the economics profession, with some commentators even arguing that it undermines the austerity policies that have proved so prevalent in the last few years.

', u'\n                    Other experts said that separate pieces of research had found similar results to the Harvard professors\u2019 paper, using alternative data sets and significantly strengthening the argument that higher-debt economies suffered from slower growth.

But they argued that the Amherst authors had also found lower growth rates when a country had debts equivalent to or greater than 90 percent of annual economic output. \u201cIt is hard to see how one can interpret these tables and individual country results as showing that public debt overhang over 90 percent is clearly benign,\u201d they wrote.        ', u'\n                    The seemingly esoteric debate within the economics profession has collided this week with a broader challenge to excessive budget-cutting in countries around the world. The I.M.F. cautioned Washington against cutting its budget too fast, too soon, even as it saw the American economy strengthening.

While noting that \u201cthe country has been through a shock\u201d in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, he argued that \u201cyou will see different loan categories start to grow.\u201d        ', u'\n                    And despite the sluggish mortgage business, the banks showed broader signs of strength on Friday and managed to report record overall profits. JPMorgan posted a 33 percent jump in first-quarter earnings, to $6.53 billion, or $1.59 a share. Those results exceeded Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.40 a share.        ', u'\n                    Wells Fargo announced a 22 percent increase in earnings, to $5.17 billion, or 92 cents a share. The results outpaced estimates of analysts polled by ', u', who had forecast earnings of 88 cents a share. For Wells, which is based in San Francisco, it was the 13th consecutive rise in quarterly earnings and the eighth consecutive record.        ', u'\n                    But revenue declined at both banks. And investors seemed skeptical about the banks\u2019 returns. Shares in both banks fell, with JPMorgan dropping 30 cents, or 0.61 percent, to $49.01, and Wells Fargo sliding 30 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $37.21.        ', u'\n                    The results of both banks represented a turning point for their mortgage business. That business has been especially lucrative of late, as the banks pass on most loans to government entities like ', u' and ', u', which guarantee the loans will be repaid. Armed with the guarantee, the banks package and sell the mortgages to investors for a significant profit.        ', u'\n                    The Federal Reserve has also stoked a refinancing boom after keeping interest rates at record lows. But the results on Friday signaled that those gains were unsustainable.        ', u'\n                    Underscoring a slowdown in refinancing, Wells Fargo said those loans accounted for 65 percent of mortgage originations in the first quarter, down from 76 percent in the period a year earlier. The bank\u2019s mortgage banking income also slipped 3 percent, presenting potential problems for Wells Fargo, whose fortunes rise and fall with the mortgage market. And while handling $109 billion in mortgage originations might be a feat for some banks, it was a 16 percent drop for Wells Fargo.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan\u2019s mortgage originations actually soared 37 percent, but new loan applications slipped 8 percent from the fourth quarter. In total, the mortgage banking group posted a profit of $673 million for the first quarter, down 31 percent from a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    Still, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, ', u', struck a confident tone about the housing market.

The government\u2019s lending standards remain too tough, he said, excluding some qualified borrowers from the market.        ', u'\n                    With the mortgage business in transition, the banks found other ways to burnish profits. For one, they cut expenses. Both banks also notched big gains in credit card and automobile lending. At JPMorgan alone, car lending grew 12 percent from a year earlier, to $6.5 billion.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan\u2019s results were also buoyed by gains in the investment banking business, where fees rose 4 percent, to $1.4 billion. The asset management business, which JPMorgan has expanded as regulations crimp other areas of the bank, reported net income of $487 million for the quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier.        ', u'\n                    The gains were further fueled by JPMorgan\u2019s decision to reduce reserves for mortgages and credit card loans. By moving money from the reserves, which cushion the bank against potential losses, the bank collected a net gain of 18 cents a share.        ', u'\n                    Addressing questions on Friday about whether the earnings are deceptively strong, Mr. Dimon said in a conference call that even after the reserve reductions, \u201cwe had really good numbers everywhere.\u201d        ', u'\n                    At Wells Fargo, the strong returns were spread across the bank. Wholesale banking, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division, reported that profits rose 9 percent. The bank also posted a 14 percent profit gain in its wealth management business. And profit in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo\u2019s retail branches and consumer lending business, climbed 24 percent, to $2.9 billion.

', u'\n                    At a Senate Banking Committee hearing, lawmakers contended that the consulting business was fraught with conflicts. While banking regulators rely on consultants to help clean up financial misdeeds like money laundering and foreclosure abuses, the companies remain on Wall Street\u2019s payroll.        ', u'\n                    \u201cConsultants have a financial incentive to do things to attract repeat business,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat leading the hearing, said to a panel of regulators who testified.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Brown also took aim at consultants, citing some recent missteps. When regulators farmed out a review of foreclosure abuses to companies like the Promontory Financial Group and Deloitte & Touche, the consultants earned $2 billion in fees while scrutinizing only a sliver of the more than 800,000 troubled loans in question.        ', u'\n                    Money laundering cases have dogged the consultants, too. Lawmakers on Thursday alluded to an episode in August, when New York officials accused Deloitte of helping the British bank ', u' cloak illicit transfers.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIf a consulting firm has routinely been at the scene of the crime, what will it take to be disqualified?\u201d Mr. Brown asked.        ', u'\n                    Konrad Alt, a Promontory executive who testified on Thursday, said \u201cit would depend on if they were at the scene of the crime as a witness, perpetrator or detective.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The Senate hearing was the latest indication that federal regulators were facing pressure to rein in the consulting industry. Representative ', u', Democrat of California, also introduced legislation this week to impose conditions on the use of consultants, including progress reports and detailed cost estimates.        ', u'\n                    The scrutiny comes on the heels of the ', u'\u2019s report that faulted regulators for the flawed foreclosure review. The regulators, the report said, failed to coordinate the review properly and potentially let some errors go undetected.        ', u'\n                    On Thursday, government officials signaled a willingness to change practices. In testimony before the Senate committee, the regulators voiced regret for outsourcing the foreclosure review to consultants paid by the banks, acknowledging for the first time that the government had \u201cunderestimated\u201d problems plaguing the process.

Mr. Brown, for one, focused on the agency\u2019s lack of written standards for overseeing consultants. When Mr. Stipano acknowledged that the comptroller\u2019s office had not yet \u201cput pen to paper,\u201d Mr. Brown remarked: \u201cI hope that part starts this afternoon.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Lawmakers also urged Mr. Stipano to identify an unnamed consulting firm that had been singled out for poor performance during the foreclosure review. While regulators wrote to the firm to complain about the conduct, they did not fire the consultant.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Stipano balked at naming the consultant. \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to do that,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthere are certain legal consequences for us if we do that.\u201d        ', u'\n                    (Promontory, Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers executives who testified on Thursday denied that their firms were the anonymous consultant in question.)

And hasn\u2019t the Obama administration said it ', u'?        ', u'\n                    Well, yes. The weird half-life of the mortgage finance giants is a result of the hoops the government went through during the financial crisis to avoid having the $5 trillion in debt being held by or guaranteed by the companies added to the actual federal debt.        ', u'\n                    The government could have fully nationalized and liquidated the companies. But if it did so, the government would have been legally deemed the owner or guarantor of the debt.        ', u'\n                    To avoid having to put the two companies on the government\u2019s balance sheet, the Treasury Department, led by ', u', decided instead to put the two into a legal purgatory known as a conservatorship. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under the supervision of their regulator. Despite being public wards, the companies have been largely run like private businesses, including paying their executives millions of dollars in compensation.        ', u'\n                    There was one exception, however. The government changed them from commercial entities with a goal of making money for stockholders into quasi-public service companies intended to help the housing mortgage market function. The government also expressly stated its goal was to eliminate the two companies and replace them with a new system of mortgage finance.        ', u'\n                    As part of all of this, the government lent the two entities almost $200 billion and received a right to acquire 79.9 percent of each company\u2019s stock. (It was set at this limit to avoid that pesky debt consolidation problem.)        ', u'\n                    All of this meant that while the companies were now under the government\u2019s thumb, the stocks still traded, left out there in an accounting maneuver worthy of the biggest multinational.        ', u'\n                    Since that time, the government has tried to damp down talk that the stocks might have any worth. They were delisted from the ', u', but still trade over the counter.        ', u'\n                    And boy do they trade. On an average day, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock have a combined volume of about 25 million shares. If the stocks were back on the New York Stock Exchange, they would be top-traded stocks.        ', u'\n                    Until a few months ago, the shares of the two companies traded like penny stocks in a range of 20 cents to 30 cents.

', u'\n                    Since the beginning of the year, however, Fannie Mae shares have surged 238 percent, to more than 86 cents. Freddie Mac shares are up 211 percent year to date, at 81.9 cents. Both surges have come in the wake of Fannie Mae posting an annual 2012 profit of $17.2 billion and Freddie Mac also putting up a big profit number of $11 billion.        ', u'\n                    The companies\u2019 combined equity value is now about $7 billion according to S.& P. Capital IQ, although $5 billion of that is attributable to the government.        ', u'\n                    Still, $2 billion is nothing to laugh at, and the number stands despite a government that has gone out of its way to make the stocks worthless. The companies have eliminated voting and dividend rights on the shares. Not only that, as Fannie Mae states in its public filings, \u201cinstead of being run for the benefit of shareholders, our company is managed in the overall interest of taxpayers, which is consistent with the substantial public investment in us.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The federal government even has agreements with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that say that through 2017 they will turn over a set measure of profits to the government. After that, they will give all of their profits to the government.        ', u'\n                    Let\u2019s face it, what value is there in a stock where you have no vote, right to dividends or profits? Let alone the fact that each company is in debt to the government by over $160 billion. Then there is the government plan to shrink them, perhaps into nothing. The recent profits are rather meaningless in this light.        ', u'\n                    Yet the trading continues.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s not an entirely new phenomenon. There are companies in bankruptcy whose stocks trade until the bankruptcy process is completed. The old ', u', for example, traded for a couple of years as the ', u' before becoming worthless. In most circumstances, the equity then disappears without value, but along the way trading continues and the company still files reports with the ', u'. This practice has never been halted, and out of foolishness or pure speculation, shareholders continue to trade bankrupt shares.        ', u'\n                    Now, neither Fannie nor Freddie is in bankruptcy. But at least in bankruptcy cases there is a small chance that a shareholder may recover some money. With Fannie and Freddie, the government is deliberately allowing trading to go on in stock that the government is going out of its way to make worthless.

', u'\n                    Some regulators say they are concerned that in some instances these transactions are not actually taking risk off bank balance sheets.

These kinds of swaps pushed the insurance giant ', u' to the brink of collapse in September 2008.

If all goes well, the investors receive an annual fee for taking on this risk. But in the worst case, where the loans in the portfolio default, the insurance that the bank has bought kicks in and covers its losses. The investors on the other side are wiped out.

Audience measurement and targeting in mobile devices, where apps rule, is way behind the Web.        ', u'\n                    Many companies are working on overcoming this mobile ad challenge, including the two giants in mobile software technology with their own operating systems and apps stores: Google and Apple.

The promise of Internet advertising is that the measurement and targeting of audiences is vastly superior to that in traditional advertising. But in mobile, where Apple and Android applications are the windows for so much viewing, audience tracking is far more difficult. Unlike the Web, where the code \u2014 so-called cookies \u2014 for identifying Internet addresses is in browser software, mobile apps lack a similar tracking tool.        ', u'\n                    \u201cSpray and pray\u201d is how ad industry experts describe most mobile campaigns. That problem could hold back the growth curve of mobile ad spending. \u201cIf you can\u2019t target ads, the utility is greatly diminished,\u201d said Karsten Weide, an analyst at IDC.        ', u'\n                    Mobilewalla\u2019s data scientists and engineers, Mr. Datta said, have created a way to pull and sift through more than two billion consumer reviews on app stores, Twitter messages and Facebook public profiles and posts. It also gets information from app publishers who agree to share user information.        ', u'\n                    The Mobilewalla team is looking for signals of sentiment and correlations in the data to try to make accurate predictions about the demographic characteristics of people using certain apps, and point to correlations and clusters of users. Its technology is a variant of the \u201ccollaborative filtering\u201d techniques used by Amazon and Netflix to make recommendations. It uses machine-learning software to find apps that share similar audiences and then humans to refine the algorithms.        ', u'\n                    For example, the ESPN app and Univision Sports app were initially in the same cluster as sports apps. But 90 percent of the ESPN users are English speakers and 78 percent of Univision\u2019s are native Spanish speakers, Mr. Datta said. They are not the same demographic group at all. So the software is tweaked accordingly.        ', u'\n                    The kindred apps can be quirky. For example, Mr. Datta said, his company\u2019s research shows the Bible! app (published by Logos Bible Software) has a significant audience overlap with apps called Slotsjourney (FishStick Games), Slotmania \u2014 Slot Machine (Playtika LTD), and Slots by Zynga (Zynga). Religious Christians, Mr. Datta said, seem to like to gamble, especially playing slots.        ', u'\n                    Another: the Drudge Report app overlaps considerably with the Domino\u2019s Pizza app. Republicans, Mr. Datta said, apparently prefer Domino\u2019s pizza. But the Pizza Hut app has a different audience.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s how they are attacking the problem that seems novel,\u201d said Ramesh Jain, a computer scientist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThey are treating this as a Big Data problem, working with huge metrics of people expressing their sentiments about apps.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The challenge is magnified by the growth and volatility of mobile apps. Every week, as about 100 new movies and 250 new books are introduced worldwide, about 15,000 smartphone apps are added to apps stores around the globe.        ', u'\n                    The churn of what\u2019s rising or falling in popularity is accelerated in smartphone apps. The turnover rate among the 100 most popular mobile apps, according to Mobilewalla\u2019s calculations, is 45 percent after 30 days and 85 percent after 90 days \u2014 double or triple of the churn rates in television or even Web sites.        ', u'\n                    Thus, a tried-and-true method of measuring audience in television and on the Web \u2014 observing the viewing behavior of panels of users \u2014 does not work for mobile apps, Mr. Datta said. The panel approach relies on persistent popularity over weeks or longer. In mobile apps, that kind of stability does not exist.

', u'\n                    Mr. Skilling\u2019s appeal gained traction with his argument that the government had relied on a dubious legal theory that Mr. Skilling deprived others of his \u201chonest service.\u201d In 2010, the Supreme Court called the use of the awkwardly written \u201chonest services\u201d law unconstitutionally vague and said his conviction was \u201cflawed.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But a federal appeals court subsequently ruled that the conviction was not tainted by the use of the theory and said there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that Mr. Skilling had conspired to commit fraud. Last year, the Supreme Court declined to hear Mr. Skilling\u2019s appeal of the appeals court ruling.

', u'\n                    So in 1986, he joined Wall Street, moving not to the trading floor, like many of his fellow rocket scientists, but into risk management. In 1990, he took his skills to ', u', rising to become the firm\u2019s head of market risk oversight. The physicist came to understand the limits of mathematical models. He learned that his job was really psychologist, confessor and detective. He became the financial version of a counterintelligence officer, searching for the missed clues and hidden dangers in the firm\u2019s trading strategies.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Breit is retired now, studying ancient Greek in his spare time and volunteering as an adviser for New York\u2019s pension funds. He comes across as George Smiley if he were a Southerner \u2014 gracious, reluctant to talk about himself, with iconoclastic opinions just below the surface. I\u2019ve been talking to him periodically over the years about how giant financial institutions should manage the aggressive traders slinging giant sums around the world in ever more complex transactions.        ', u'\n                    After the Senate issued a report last month on ', u'\u2019s multibillion-dollar London whale trading loss, an incident where the mathematical modeling went seriously wrong, I reached out to him again.        ', u'\n                    That debacle encapsulates much of what is wrong about how banks manage their risk and how the regulators oversee those efforts. At JPMorgan Chase, the risk models hid \u2014 and were used to hide \u2014 risks from the traders and top executives. Too many measures and too many numbers undid the risk managers. But ultimately, they failed because of human frailties; the risk managers lost sight of their mission and tried to protect the traders and their trades. As in all spy debacles, the counterintelligence officers got co-opted.        ', u'\n                    Early in his career, Mr. Breit figured out that models for markets aren\u2019t like those for physics. They don\u2019t come from nature. It was necessary to know the math, if only so that he couldn\u2019t be intimidated by the quantitative analysts.        ', u'\n                    But the numbers more often disguise risk than reveal it. \u201cI went down the statistical path,\u201d he said. He built one of the first value-at-risk models, or VaR, a mathematical formula that is supposed to distill how much risk a firm is running at any given point.        ', u'\n                    The only thing from capital markets math he came to embrace was this immutable law of nature: investors make money by taking risk. \u201cIf it\u2019s profitable and seems riskless, it\u2019s a business you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he told me.        ', u'\n                    Instead of fixating on models, risk managers need to develop what spies call humint \u2014 human intelligence from flesh and blood sources. They need to build networks of people who will trust them enough to report when things seem off, before they become spectacular problems. Mr. Breit, who attributes this approach to his mentor, Daniel Napoli, the former head of risk at Merrill Lynch, took people out drinking to get them to open up. He cultivated junior accountants.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThey see things first,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost every trading debacle was sitting on some accountant\u2019s desk.\u201d        ', u'\n                    All the while, he was on the lookout for bad trades. Most traders who get into trouble, he thinks, aren\u2019t bad guys. The bad ones, who try to cover up improper trades, are relatively easy to detect. The real threat, he said, comes from the \u201ccrazy ones\u201d who really believe they\u2019ve found ways to spin flax into gold. They can blow up a firm with the best of intentions.        ', u'\n                    They don\u2019t do it suddenly. \u201cI hate the whole Black Swan concept,\u201d he said, referring to the notion, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, that the true risks lie in unforeseeable events that occur with much more frequency than the mathematical models suggest. \u201cIt takes years of concerted effort to lose a lot.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Yes, a big market move might reveal a fatally flawed trade, but that volatility is not the root cause of an oversize loss.        ', u'\n                    The problem, as Mr. Breit sees it, is that this has nothing to do with how risk management is practiced today, or what the regulators encourage.

Still, the new move may reduce spontaneity because companies may limit their communications to official corporate accounts and file the information with the agency at the same time.        ', u'\n                    With the decision, the S.E.C is playing catch-up to the new era of social media.        ', u'\n                    In December, the regulator warned ', u' that it could take action against the company for a 43-word message that the company\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, posted in his personal Facebook feed. In the note, Mr. Hastings congratulated his team for exceeding one billion hours of video watched in a single month.        ', u'\n                    But the federal agency raised concerns that the post violated ', u', commonly known as Reg FD, which requires a company to publish material information to all investors at the same time. While Mr. Hastings\u2019s announcement was made on his publicly available Facebook page, which had over 200,000 followers, the information was not subsequently disclosed in a securities filing or news release.        ', u'\n                    At the time, Mr. Hastings and Netflix said that his message was both immaterial and readily available to investors, having been picked up by a number of blogs and news media outlets. \u201cWe use blogging and social media, including Facebook, to communicate effectively with the public and our members,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote \u2014 on his Facebook page, naturally \u2014 after disclosing the investigation last year.        ', u'\n                    Now, the S.E.C. seems to be relaxing its stance.        ', u'\n                    After an investigation of several months, regulators said that companies could treat social media as legitimate outlets for communication, much like corporate Web sites or the agency\u2019s own public filing system called Edgar. The catch is that corporations have to make clear which Twitter feeds or Facebook pages will serve as potential outlets for announcements.

', u'\n                    In developing its rules, the agency also let Mr. Hastings avoid sanctions for his Facebook post. Neither the chief executive nor Netflix incurred any penalties since receiving the so-called Wells notice from the agency in December.

', u'\n                    As in the past, the S.E.C. is treading carefully in its corporate disclosure policies. In 2008, the regulator clarified that corporate Web sites alone could qualify as wide disclosure if investors already knew that those pages could be sources of material information.

At a bar after the office party, Mr. Monteverde and Ms. Marchuk were seen kissing and fondling one other. At 3 a.m., the two went back to the law firm\u2019s offices, the complaint said.

Welcome to the newest trend in activist investing: hedge funds paying their nominees to a company\u2019s board as if they were chief executives.\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe latest examples can be found in two prominent proxy fights. In the first, Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management has acquired about $800 million in stock of the ', u', the integrated oil company. The hedge fund has nominated five directors to the 14-member Hess board and is agitating for change, arguing that the company has substantially underperformed its peers by 460 percent over the last 17 years.        ', u'\n                    In the second, Barry Rosenstein\u2019s Jana Partners is storming the ramparts of Agrium, acquiring about 7.5 percent of the company, an agriculture supply retailer and wholesaler based in Calgary, Alberta. Jana, which contends Agrium has underperformed its peers by 160 percent over the last five years, has nominated five directors to the company\u2019s 12-member board.        ', u'\n                    Agitating for changes and waging proxy fights are familiar pages from the activist investor playbook. What\u2019s different here is that each hedge fund is promising to pay its director candidates what are essentially bonuses that could run into millions of dollars, if not more.        ', u'\n                    In Elliott\u2019s case, its five nominees will be paid a $50,000 retainer, a mere tip. The kicker is that any of its nominees who win a seat on the Hess board and serve for a year will be paid an aggregate $30,000 for each percentage point the stock price of Hess outperforms a peer group of stocks over three years from January 2013, when the stock was trading at about $58 a share (it\u2019s at $70 now). The total potential payment tops out at $9 million for each director \u2014 or 300 percent outperformance, an admittedly fantastic return for everyone if it occurs.        ', u'\n                    Jana is paying its nominees in a more direct and potentially more lucrative manner. Jana\u2019s nominees also get $50,000 each, but they will receive 2.6 percent of Jana\u2019s net profit from the price of Agrium shares as of Sept. 27, 2012, if they are elected (Agrium\u2019s stock then was $102.99 in New York, and is currently trading a few dollars below that). If they are not elected, they will still receive 1.8 percent of Jana\u2019s net profit. The hedge fund\u2019s investment is about $1 billion, so we are talking about potential millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars.        ', u'\n                    Any way you slice it, Jana and Elliott are raising the ante for director compensation. A ', u' found that the average director made $134,000 in annual cash and incentive compensation from 2006 to 2010. And this week, Susanne Craig of The New York Times reported that some ', u' directors ', u'. That\u2019s a nice sum, but these hedge fund-nominated directors stand to make much more.        ', u'\n                    Not surprisingly, both Agrium and Hess are up in arms about the hedge funds\u2019 plans to pay their nominees. They make two basic arguments.        ', u'\n                    The first is that the hedge fund directors are not independent. Because the directors are being paid by the hedge fund, they will be loyal to the hedge fund, rather than the company.        ', u'\n                    The second is that by paying these directors large sums over three years, the hedge fund nominees will aim for short-term performance and not care what happens to the company in the longer term.        ', u'\n                    The counterargument has been put forth most forcefully by Jana. The hedge fund argues that the compensation system is hard-wired. Jana (and Elliott, for that matter) have already agreed to pay these amounts and can\u2019t renege, so the directors are no longer beholden to the hedge fund, if they ever were.        ', u'\n                    Jana also contends that its compensation arrangement is better than other kinds of director pay, since it better aligns the company\u2019s performance with the directors\u2019.        ', u'\n                    Elliott echoed this, saying in a statement: \u201cThere is no link to any plan, there is no discretion by Elliott, and the term is longer than any compensation offered by Hess. In other words, there is complete alignment with long-term shareholders\u2019 interests.\u201d        ', u'\n                    So who is right?        ', u'\n                    First, as long as the arrangement is disclosed and the hedge funds don\u2019t exert any future control over the nominees, it is unlikely that this violates any state or federal law. Here, director compensation falls into the same basket as ', u'.        ', u'\n                    The examples of hedge funds paying directors are all over the place.        ', u'\n                    Some funds, like Pershing Square Capital Management, do not directly compensate nominees. Other funds pay just a flat fee of $50,000 to $150,000. And then there are arrangements like the one ', u' had with Frank J. Biondi Jr., the former chief executive ', u', during Mr. Icahn\u2019s battle with ', u' in 2006.

According to Dell\u2019s proxy, Evercore contacted \u201c67 parties, including 19 strategic parties, 18 financial sponsors and 30 other parties.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Most were not interested. And then Blackstone arrived.        ', u'\n                    What did Mr. Schwarzman see that all of the other prospective bidders must have missed? That remains a mystery.        ', u'\n                    But what Mr. Schwarzman did next, thanks to Dell\u2019s disclosure, may go a long way toward explaining what\u2019s truly going on: Blackstone told Dell that it would not even consider bidding for the company unless Dell offered to pay the firm\u2019s expenses, up to a whopping $25 million.        ', u'\n                    Yes, you read that correctly. Blackstone demanded that Dell pay it to go through the motions of bidding.        ', u'\n                    Here it is in the proxy: \u201cThe Blackstone consortium informed the special committee that it was not willing to proceed with its evaluation of the transaction contemplated\u201d unless \u201cit received an agreement from the company to reimburse the Blackstone consortium\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its evaluation of a possible transaction.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Here\u2019s what\u2019s not in the proxy: Originally, Blackstone did not demand to be reimbursed for just out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 for consultants, travel and the like \u2014 but also sought to be able to receive payments for the time of its own executives, according to people involved in the process. Just think about it: How much would Mr. Schwarzman bill for his time? $10,000 an hour?        ', u'\n                    Ultimately, Dell\u2019s special committee agreed to pay Blackstone\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses but not hourly fees or contingency fees for its banking advisers. (By the way, the special committee also agreed to pay Silver Lake the same reimbursement to make the process fair.)        ', u'\n                    The fact that Blackstone refused to bid unless its costs were covered by Dell \u2014 a highly unusual maneuver \u2014 just goes to show you how little confidence it has that it expects to submit a winning bid for Dell.        ', u'\n                    Blackstone also required Dell to indemnify the firm from any lawsuits stemming from its involvement in the auction process, according to Dell\u2019s documents.        ', u'\n                    For Dell\u2019s special committee, agreeing to these bold demands from Blackstone is probably good business. If the board can keep a second bidder at the table, even if the suitor never makes a firm bid, Dell\u2019s special committee will have insulated itself from criticism that it did not run a competitive process.        ', u'\n                    The real question is why, despite the $25 million reimbursement guarantee, Blackstone is risking its reputation to even contemplate a deal for Dell.        ', u'\n                    If Blackstone makes a formal bid \u2014 and so far it has not lined up financing \u2014 it will most likely be competing against a bid from Mr. Dell. While Blackstone has clearly been invited into the auction process, if Mr. Dell quits or is ousted as a result of a winning bid from Blackstone, the firm will appear to have made a hostile bid. Private equity firms have spent the last 25 years avoiding anything that could make them perceived as hostile because they typically want management teams to want to do business with them.        ', u'\n                    Last week, two Blackstone partners, Chinh Chu and David Johnson, who recently defected from Dell, met with Mr. Dell at his home. Mr. Dell is said to be open to working with Blackstone if they can agree on strategy, operations and corporate governance.        ', u'\n                    But by the looks of it, Blackstone and Mr. Dell are coming to the table from entirely different angles. Mr. Dell wants to keep the company intact and reinvest in developing the personal computer, tablet and emerging-market business. Blackstone\u2019s strategy appears to center on selling Dell\u2019s financing arm \u2014 it received some interest from GE Capital \u2014 and focusing on its services business.        ', u'\n                    What happens if Mr. Dell comes out with the following statement? \u201cUnfortunately, after holding talks with Blackstone in good faith, I can\u2019t participate in their transaction because of a disagreement over strategy. Their plan is a short-term and shortsighted effort to break up the company and put in peril Dell\u2019s more than 100,000 employees.\u201d        ', u'\n                    All of sudden, Blackstone would look like a barbarian at the gate in a big and very public nasty battle. (Some would claim Mr. Dell was being selfish, but the damage would be done \u2014 to Blackstone.)        ', u'\n                    Alternatively, is it really possible Blackstone would try to embrace Mr. Dell and make him the chief executive \u2014 which they have said they are open to doing? Blackstone has already been canvassing for other candidates. In fact, the firm contacted Mark Hurd of Oracle before ever even discussing the matter with Mr. Dell, which, of course, was a not-so-great way to ingratiate itself with a potential future partner.        ', u'\n                    And then there\u2019s the ownership stakes. Mr. Dell owns about 15 percent of the equity in Dell. It is almost impossible to believe that Blackstone would put in more equity than Mr. Dell already has in the company. That would leave Blackstone as a smaller equity owner than Mr. Dell himself. Would Blackstone really team up with him and let him have control of the company?        ', u'\n                    All of these questions have no good answers. But for $25 million in reimbursed expenses, maybe they don\u2019t need them.        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

That, analysts said, would mean a new approach to the lucrative U.S. market in the aftermath of the failed BAE merger.

Cassidian, he noted, owns significant, but not controlling, stakes in some of Europe\u2019s biggest military joint ventures, including Eurofighter, the producer of the Typhoon combat jet, and MBDA, a missile manufacturer, as well as niche activities in military electronics and security.

Like most military contractors in recent years, Cassidian, which contributed about half of EADS\u2019s \u20ac12 billion, or $15 billion, in defense revenue last year, has seen its growth stalled by sharp budget cutbacks in Europe and the United States. Stagnant earnings have prompted two restructurings of the unit since 2011, resulting in the loss of about 1,500 jobs. Cassidian\u2019s operating profit plunged 57 percent last year, to \u20ac142 million.

Operating profit more than doubled, to \u20ac1.1 billion from \u20ac543 million in 2011.

A phone with a strong Facebook focus would prompt customers to use Facebook more than competing apps and services. But the success of such a device would depend on how much support the handset received from wireless carriers, said Chetan Sharma, an independent telecommunications analyst who consults for carriers.

He said it would be better for Facebook to create a special layer that consumers could install on Android devices so the social network would embed more deeply into Android apps and Google services.

This year the company introduced Poke, a private messaging service, as a stand-alone app. Last year, it released a camera app that specialized in tagging and uploading photos to Facebook.

It certainly is your responsibility as a pet owner to make sure you can provide and pay for basic veterinary care to your animal, along with food, toys, and lots of love.  But not everyone can foot the bill for, say, a kidney transplant for their cat, or an amputation for their dog.  Could you put it on a credit card? Would that hurt you financially? If you do pay for a high-cost surgery, will you be able to stay with and care for your pet while it recovers at home? You have to make those decisions, in consultation with your vet. But don\u2019t be shy about asking your veterinarian about all the options available to you.

But if you love your pet, and have given it a wonderful life, you have to trust yourself to make the right decision. As we noted in the story, you also need to consider what kind of life your pet would have even if you pay to extend it through extraordinary measures. You also need to factor in what kinds of spending and saving decisions you will have to make if you do go into debt to save your pet. There is no one right answer for anyone.

The best way, just as with humans, is to keep current with annual checkups, and go to the veterinarian as soon as you think there may be something wrong. It\u2019s always more expensive to treat an illness is advanced stages than it is to keep something from becoming a full-blown crisis.        ', u'\n                    You should also shop around for veterinary care. Call a few and ask what they charge for a basic exam (that is, to walk in the door). Ask friends who have pets what they pay for checkups and emergency care. Based on an admittedly unscientific survey (my friends), the average cost of an annual checkup in my area of Los Angeles is $50.

Target even has a special program called PetRx that includes $4 generics.        ', u'\n                    Emergency care is another story, though. When your pet is in critical condition, you won\u2019t be in a position to shop around. So look up the pet hospitals nearest you and do some research on your own before something happens to your pet. And never be afraid to ask about cost before your pet is taken away for surgery or any other procedure. For most of us, cost has to be a factor in our decision-making around pet care, and veterinary care providers know that.        ', u'\n                    Q.

Pet insurance also operates on a reimbursement model, where you pay upfront and then are paid back after filing a claim.

In these cases, having pet insurance may make those decisions a little easier since some of the costs will be defrayed. But be sure you read the fine print if you decide to get a policy, because there are limits on how much the insurance company will pay.

I wonder if something super simple, like tracking a single number, consistently and for a long time, may be the subtle nudge we need to improve our finances.

But it can be effective and simple.        ', u'\n                    Take 10 minutes at the end of each day and record what you spent. Use a notebook or your favorite app and track it.

', u'\n                    One of the reasons I focus on spending is that people think tracking doesn\u2019t help. A great (or not so great) example is the time I taught a financial literacy class to people who were working their way out of the local homeless shelter. The first week, 20 people would show up. I gave them a pocket-size spiral notebook and asked them to record everything they spent for one week and to come back so we could move onto the next step. No one ever came back.

', u'\n                    Mr. Zucker has declined interview requests since taking over as chief executive of CNN Worldwide in January. But his pairing of Mr. Cuomo, 42, and Ms. Bolduan, 29, suggests that he sees an opening for a morning show that is generationally different \u2014 or, to put it more bluntly, a morning show that has younger faces.        ', u'\n                    The top producer of the forthcoming program will be Jim Murphy, who ran ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in the late 2000s while Mr. Cuomo was the news anchor of that program. Mr. Murphy, whose hiring was announced internally in February, said in a telephone interview that the CNN program would be a \u201cwide-ranging morning show.\u201d        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe\u2019re not going to reinvent the wheel,\u201d he said, seemingly trying to manage expectations. \u201cBut what we will provide people, I think, is a fresher, more energetic, more conversational and more interesting morning show than what they\u2019re used to.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some of the specifics about the format and the content are still being sorted out, Mr. Murphy said. But he indicated that the new show \u201cwill not be all politics like MSNBC is,\u201d referring to \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d or \u201cas consistently about social issues as Fox is,\u201d referring to \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Both \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cFox & Friends\u201d routinely outperform \u201cStarting Point\u201d in ratings, which may be part of the reason why Mr. Zucker has decided to start over from scratch and make a new show. \u201cStarting Point\u201d was plagued by executive-level disagreements about what the show should and shouldn\u2019t be. Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s associates complained that the show wasn\u2019t supported internally or promoted externally.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Zucker and Mr. Murphy seem determined not to repeat those missteps. Mr. Murphy said in the interview that \u201cwe really did cast a wide net\u201d as the new management considered possible co-hosts for Mr. Cuomo.        ', u'\n                    Of Ms. Bolduan, he said, \u201cIt is a surprising choice, and we know that.\u201d That\u2019s because Mr. Zucker originally planned to pair Mr. Cuomo with Erin Burnett, a better-known host who CNN hired away from CNBC two years ago. But the plan fell apart, reportedly due to Ms. Burnett\u2019s unwillingness to move to the morning time slot. She currently hosts a 7 p.m. newscast, \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d        ', u'\n                    CNN executives portrayed this as a good thing, because it led them to Ms. Bolduan, who wowed Mr. Zucker and his lieutenants. Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Bolduan had obvious chemistry when they tried hosting together in an internal test, and that\u2019s what morning producers look for when they put people together.        ', u'\n                    Ms. Bolduan, who at 29 will be the youngest morning host on any major television network, will move to New York from Washington for the new job. She is currently a congressional correspondent for CNN. She joined the channel in 2007 as a correspondent for the CNN service that provides news to local television stations. She was promoted to the main channel in 2009. Ms. Bolduan has gained a little bit of hosting experience lately by co-hosting one hour of \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d in Washington. But she hasn\u2019t anchored elsewhere, so the new morning show could have something of a learning curve.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt is a huge opportunity to work on this new show,\u201d she said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cKnowing that we have the resources of some of the most experienced executives in the business, the backing of a brand like CNN, and to be able to sit alongside such great people as Chris and Michaela \u2014 I can\u2019t think of a better combination.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Executives at CNN have said they know \u2014 and they want others to know \u2014 that the rebuilding of the channel\u2019s daily schedule will take time. But the channel\u2019s recent ratings lows suggest that it is primed for a comeback of sorts. \u201cStarting Point,\u201d for instance, averaged just 234,000 viewers last year, CNN\u2019s lowest total viewer number in that time slot in more than a decade.        ', u'\n                    Inside the network, there is confidence that Mr. Zucker can increase its market share in the mornings.

', u'\n                    It\u2019s a sign that Chinese companies are growing up. As the country\u2019s economy continues to open up, private sector businesses have looked to foreign investment to finance their expansion efforts, rather than relying on hard-to-get loans from the state-controlled banks.        ', u'\n                    The junk bond market in China took off this year. Although the deals still account for a small share of the global total, Chinese companies have sold $8 billion of high-yield bonds to overseas investors since January. That\u2019s up from $2.3 billion during the same period a year earlier, according to figures from Dealogic.        ', u'\n                    \u201cBond markets are booming because companies have had difficulty getting the level of debt they want out of banks onshore or offshore, and in tapping equity markets,\u201d said Nick Gronow, a senior managing director at ', u' in Hong Kong and an expert in Chinese bankruptcies. \u201cSo bonds have really taken up the slack.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But the pace of growth is troubling to some analysts.        ', u'\n                    As investors have plowed into junk bonds across the globe, yields have plummeted. In the United States, rates on junk bonds have dipped below 6 percent, compared with historical payouts of roughly 10 percent or more.        ', u'\n                    The trend is similar in China.        ', u'\n                    Country Garden, a builder based in the southern city of Guangzhou, raised $750 million in January by selling 10-year bonds that paid 7.5 percent a year. In 2011, the company sold $900 million of seven-year bonds at a much higher 11.125 percent.        ', u'\n                    The borrowing costs for Kaisa Group Holdings, a commercial real estate company in the southern city of Shenzhen, have also dropped rapidly. In September, it sold $250 million of five-year bonds at 12.875 percent. By January, it was able to sell $500 million of bonds at 10.25 percent. This month, it issued new bonds at 8.875 percent.        ', u'\n                    \u201cChinese real estate issuance is happening for structural reasons: 50 percent of the population needs to be urbanized and housed, traditional funding from banks may be more restricted now, and global appetite for yield is on the rise,\u201d said Gregorio Saichin, the London-based head of emerging markets and high-yield, fixed-income portfolio management at Pioneer Investments. \u201cWhen you combine all the above factors with a massive refinancing exercise by Chinese property developers, you get this type of outcome.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But it\u2019s a slim difference in yields for such disparate markets.        ', u'\n                    Chinese high-yield bonds have many of the same characteristics \u2014 and risks \u2014 as American debt. They tend to be sold by companies looking to finance ventures in new or untested areas or businesses that compete in industries where earnings are subject to volatile swings.        ', u'\n                    But the Chinese market has its own set of potential problems, and some analysts worry that investors aren\u2019t being properly compensated for the added layer of risks.        ', u'\n                    For one, the bulk of the high-yield bonds in Asia this year \u2014 roughly half \u2014 come from Chinese real estate companies. The fear is that the housing market, which has been booming, is a bubble that will eventually burst.        ', u'\n                    The industry is especially uncertain, given the periodic government intervention. On March 1, Beijing announced new measures to curb excess in the market, including the strict enforcement of a 20 percent capital gains tax on the sale of preowned homes.

', u'\n                    Mainland China\u2019s domestic bond market remains largely off limits to foreign buyers. So most investors buy offshore Chinese bonds, which are issued through holding companies headquartered in places like the Cayman Islands.        ', u'\n                    The bonds tend not to be backed by the actual businesses and underlying assets in mainland China. That means foreign bondholders may have little legal recourse if a company defaults on its debt, especially if local banks or other Chinese creditors make claims.        ', u'\n                    Bondholders are now facing such difficulties with the bankruptcy of Suntech Power.

On March 21, a court in Wuxi, a city in eastern China, accepted a bankruptcy petition filed by eight Chinese banks against Suntech\u2019s main operating unit in China, a group that is seeking to recoup some of the money it lent to the company.        ', u'\n                    If previous Chinese bankruptcies are any indicator, those local banks will take priority in the so-called liquidation process, while foreign bondholders may lose everything. \u201cThe greatest difficulty the bondholders have, when things go wrong, is what leverage do they actually have against the company?\u201d Mr. Gronow of FTI Consulting said.        ', u'\n                    The answer, usually, is not much. Mr. Gronow cites the case of Asia Aluminum, a manufacturer in the small southern city of Zhaoqing that collapsed in 2009 after accumulating more than $1.7 billion in debt.        ', u'\n                    After several months of often strained negotiations between the company, mainland and Hong Kong banks, foreign bondholders and the government, Mr. Gronow and his co-workers, acting as liquidators, worked out a deal that gave back Asia Aluminum\u2019s bank creditors in Hong Kong 100 percent of their capital.        ', u'\n                    Others were not so lucky. The owners of bonds issued by one offshore subsidiary received about 20 cents on the dollar.

', u'\n                    Judge Marrero reserved judgment on approving the settlement, which related to allegations that SAC made $276 million in avoided losses and profits by illegally trading two pharmaceutical stocks after an employee obtained secret information from a doctor about drug trials. But the judge made it clear that he was troubled.        ', u'\n                    The hedge fund, based in Greenwich, Conn., has emerged as a focus of the federal government\u2019s long-running inquiry into criminal activity at hedge funds. Earlier this month, SAC agreed to settle two insider-trading cases: one for $602 million, which was at issue Thursday, and the other for $14 million.        ', u'\n                    At least nine current or former SAC employees have been tied to insider trading while at the firm. One of them is Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager who was indicted on charges that he illegally traded the drug stocks ', u' and Wyeth. Mr. Martoma, who has pleaded not guilty, was also named in the S.E.C. lawsuit but has not settled with regulators. He did not attend the hearing, but his lawyer, Charles A. Stillman, was there, as was Mr. Martoma\u2019s wife.        ', u'\n                    The Martoma case has heightened the scrutiny of Mr. Cohen because he traded shares of Elan and Wyeth alongside Mr. Martoma. Mr. Cohen has not been charged or sued by the government, and has denied any wrongdoing. In recent days, he made headlines for embarking on a shopping spree, agreeing to pay $60 million for an oceanfront estate in the Hamptons and purchasing a Picasso painting for $155 million.

Most prominently, Judge ', u' rejected the settlement of a fraud case brought against ', u' by the S.E.C. that let the bank avoid an acknowledgment that it did anything wrong.

', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most serious commercial problem that the banks have,\u201d said Paul Slater, chairman of the First International Corporation, a consulting firm in Naples, Fla., that specializes in shipping. Banks with large portfolios of shipping loans \u201care just not taking the hits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are saying, \u2018Give it time and it will work out,\u2019 and it\u2019s just not going to do that.\u201d        ', u'\n                    For weak banks, the temptation to play down potential losses may be great. A frank appraisal of their losses would force some to raise billions in new capital or even to declare insolvency. That is true not only of shipping loans but also of other categories like commercial real estate, and it remains a fundamental problem for the euro zone economy.        ', u'\n                    The uncertainty about banks\u2019 true financial health fosters mistrust among institutions, makes them reluctant to lend to each other and is partly responsible for a shortage of credit for businesses and consumers.        ', u'\n                    As sour assets go, ships are particularly troublesome. Unlike a plot of land, they require costly maintenance. They lose value over time from wear and tear or because more modern, fuel-efficient vessels make them obsolete. It costs money even to take an underused ship out of service and park it somewhere. The waters off Falmouth in Britain and Elefsina in Greece are popular anchoring spots for idle ships.        ', u'\n                    Investment funds that specialize in buying distressed debt have been wary about putting money into ships. That makes it hard for banks to unload unwanted shipping assets.

Some cards have introductory zero interest rate periods of up to 18 months. If you use such transfers strategically,\xa0 he says, you can lower the rate on your car loan, saving as much as $1,000 in interest charges.        ', u'\n                    If you have just one to two years left on your auto loan, he says, that means the credit card pays off your car loan, getting you the title to the car sooner than expected, and \u201censuring that payment difficulties won\u2019t result in your car being repossessed.\u201d        ', u'\n                    The catch, of course, is that you actually have to pay off the loan before the zero interest period expires. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up paying double-digit interest on the balance, negating any advantage from transferring the loan.        ', u'\n                    There are all sorts of potential downsides to such a move, says ', u', a credit expert who writes for several financial Web sites. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous for a variety of reasons,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    First, he said, your credit score may take a hit simply because you\u2019ve applied for new credit. In addition, you\u2019re trading installment debt for revolving debt, which also tends to have a negative impact on your credit score. Installment debt has much less of an effect on your credit score than revolving, or credit card debt, because its typically secured by something and is less risky for the lender. Revolving debt is riskiest for the lender, so it has more impact on your score.        ', u'\n                    \u201cUnless you\u2019re financially capable of writing a check at the end of one year, you shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. And if you\u2019re capable of doing that, he said, why not just write a check to pay off the car loan yourself?        ', u'\n                    Another potential flaw in the plan, he said, is that most zero percent interest offers are made only to people with sterling credit. And if your credit is that strong, you likely aren\u2019t in a bind that would require transferring debt onto another card.        ', u'\n                    In short, it sounds interesting, \u201cbut if you think through the impact, it\u2019s not really a good idea,\u201d he said.

', u'\n                    The policy shift is playing out as the nation\u2019s biggest lenders face heightened scrutiny from federal and state regulators for enabling online payday lenders to thwart state law. With 15 states banning payday loans, a growing number of the lenders have set up online operations in more hospitable states or foreign locales like Belize, Malta and the West Indies to more nimbly dodge statewide caps on interest rates.        ', u'\n                    ', u' and ', u' said that their policies on payday loans remained unchanged.

', u'\n                    While JPMorgan Chase never directly made the loans, the bank, along with other major banks, is a critical link for the payday lenders. The banks allow the lenders to automatically withdraw payments from borrowers\u2019 bank accounts, even in states like New York where the loans are illegal. The withdrawals often continue unabated, even after customers plead with the banks to stop the payments, according to interviews with consumer lawyers, banking regulators and lawmakers.        ', u'\n                    The changes at JPMorgan, which will go into effect by the end of May, will keep bank customers from racking up hundreds of dollars in fees, generated when the payday lenders repeatedly try to debit borrowers\u2019 accounts. Still, the changes will not prevent the payday lenders from extending high-cost credit to people living in the states where the loans are banned.        ', u'\n                    It is possible that other lenders could institute changes, especially because rivals have followed JPMorgan\u2019s lead in recent years. In 2009, for example, after JPMorgan capped overdraft fees at three a day, Wells Fargo also changed its policies to reduce the number of daily penalties charged.        ', u'\n                    The changes come as state and federal officials are zeroing in on how the banks enable online payday lenders to bypass state laws that ban the loans. By allowing the payday lenders to easily access customers\u2019 accounts, the authorities say the banks frustrate government efforts to protect borrowers from the loans, which some authorities have decried as predatory.        ', u'\n                    Both the ', u' and the ', u' are scrutinizing how the banks enable the lenders to dodge restrictions, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter. In New York, where JPMorgan has its headquarters, Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state\u2019s top banking regulator, is investigating the bank\u2019s role in enabling lenders to break state law, which caps interest rates on loans at 25 percent.        ', u'\n                    Facing restrictions across the country, payday lenders have migrated online and offshore. There is scant data about how many lenders have moved online, but as of 2011, the volume of online payday loans was $13 billion, up more than 120 percent from $5.8 billion in 2006, according to John Hecht, an analyst with the investment bank Stephens Inc.        ', u'\n                    By 2016, Mr. Hecht expects Internet loans to dominate the payday lending landscape, making up about 60 percent of the total payday loans extended.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan said that the bank will charge only one returned item fee per lender in a 30-day period when customers do not have enough money in their accounts to cover the withdrawals.        ', u'\n                    That shift is likely to help borrowers like Ivy Brodsky, 37, who was charged $1,523 in fees \u2014 a combination of insufficient funds, service fees and overdraft fees \u2014 in a single month after six Internet payday lenders tried to withdraw money from her account 55 times.        ', u'\n                    Another change at JPMorgan is intended to address the difficulty that payday loan customers face when they try to pay off their loans in full. Unless a customer contacts the online lender three days before the next withdrawal, the lender just rolls the loan over automatically, withdrawing solely the interest owed.        ', u'\n                    Even borrowers who contact lenders days ahead of time can find themselves lost in a dizzying Internet maze, according to consumer lawyers. Requests are not honored, callers reach voice recordings and the withdrawals continue, the lawyers say.        ', u'\n                    For borrowers, frustrated and harried, the banks are often the last hope to halt the debits. Although under federal law customers have the right to stop withdrawals, some borrowers say their banks do not honor their requests.        ', u'\n                    Polly Larimer, who lives in Richmond, Va., said she begged Bank of America last year to stop payday lenders from eroding what little money she had in her account. Ms. Larimer said that the bank did not honor her request for five months. In that time period, she was charged more than $1,300 in penalty fees, according to bank statements reviewed by The Times. Bank of America declined to comment.        ', u'\n                    To combat such problems, JPMorgan said the bank will provide training to their employees so that stop-payment requests are honored.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan will also make it much easier for customers to close their bank accounts. Until now, bank customers could not close their checking accounts unless all pending charges have been settled. The bank will now allow customers to close accounts if pending charges are deemed \u201cinappropriate.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Some of the changes at JPMorgan Chase echo a bill introduced in July by Senator ', u', Democrat of Oregon, to further rein in payday lending.        ', u'\n                    A critical piece of that bill, pending in Congress, would enable borrowers to more easily halt the automatic withdrawals. The bill would also force lenders to abide by laws in the state where the borrower lives, rather than where the lender is.        ', u'\n                    JPMorgan Chase said it is \u201cworking to proactively identify\u201d when lenders misuse automatic withdrawals.

Yet as shareholders of ', u' may be about to find out, it can also be all about subtraction, as a company ditches an unwanted business, in this case, magazines.\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe business argument for a spinoff is typically that a separation of the assets allows both the former parent and the newly independent company to be better run, freeing management to take bolder steps with the new company. And because Wall Street is a place where magic works, the market will recognize this, giving each of the separated companies a higher price.        ', u'\n                    There is evidence of this effect. Studies of spinoffs ', u' that they produce short-term gains, although these gains evaporate over the long term.        ', u'\n                    Spinoffs, not surprisingly, are big business these days on Wall Street. Last year, there were 85 spinoffs worldwide worth $109 billion, according to Dealogic, down just a bit from 93 spinoffs worth $128 billion in 2011.        ', u'\n                    But spinoffs have a dark side, as they can serve as a convenient dumping ground. In 1999, ', u' spun off its auto parts maker into Delphi, and the following year, ', u' did the same with Visteon. Both automakers larded the subsidiaries with too much debt, high labor costs and sweetheart pricing deals. The result sent both spinoffs into bankruptcy. Ford and G.M. are still dealing with the fallout and litigation.        ', u'\n                    These deals show the temptation lurking in a spinoff: liabilities can be freely attached to the company being spun off. This is often management\u2019s best opportunity to burnish its own company at another\u2019s expense. It\u2019s hard to resist.        ', u'\n                    Take Tronox, the world\u2019s third-largest maker of pigment titanium dioxide, which was spun off from Kerr-McGee in 2006. It was given all of Kerr-McGee\u2019s environmental liabilities plus $200 million in debt, which it used to pay a pre-spinoff dividend to the parent. The company went bankrupt and is still litigating with Andarko, which later acquired Kerr-McGee, over allegations that the company had been sent off into the world without the resources to survive, let alone thrive.        ', u'\n                    Another example is Idearc\u2019s spinoff from ', u'. Before being set free, Idearc claims  that it took on $9 billion in debt to pay Verizon, also transferring some $2 billion in cash to Verizon. Idearc, a print and online directory business, soon went bankrupt. Idearc\u2019s bankruptcy trustee later sued Verizon, claiming that the spinoff was a convenient way to get rid of a business Verizon did not know what to do with.        ', u'\n                    The reason a spinoff is a preferred way to get rid of businesses a company no longer wants is that shareholders have no choice in the matter. The decision is simply made by the board.        ', u'\n                    The alternative is a sale of the company, but that requires someone to buy it. A spinoff is thus not only an alluring and convenient way to clean up the parent\u2019s balance sheet, it is also a way for managers to show faster earnings improvement by easily discarding a low- or no-growth business.        ', u'\n                    Another example is ', u'. Unable to sell the video rental company, its parent, ', u', spun it off, but before doing so arranged for the company to borrow $1 billion and pay a $905 million special dividend. Unfortunately, Blockbuster was spun off just as the industry began to experience big changes. With a bigger parent company, Blockbuster might have survived; but it was unable to cope and it, too, filed for bankruptcy.        ', u'\n                    Sometimes, businesses are spun off simply because they make no sense together. As a result, Frankenstein companies, random businesses stitched together, are created and sent out to the public markets without a clear strategy.        ', u'\n                    The ', u' spun off Vlasic Foods International in 1998 in order to focus on its higher margin and growth brands.

', u'\n                    In addition, $500 million in debt was transferred to the new company. Vlasic Foods announced a reorganization four days after the spinoff and announced three months later that it was likely to default on its debt, eventually declaring bankruptcy.        ', u'\n                    This brings us to Time Warner. After failed talks that would have created a joint venture magazine company with Meredith, Time Warner was faced with the unpalatable choice of keeping the magazines or spinning them off.

In the latest disclosures on Friday, ', u', which is 82 percent owned by the British government after receiving a bailout during the financial crisis, announced on Friday that 93 of its employees earned more than more than \xa31 million, or $1.5 million, last year.

HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, also said on Monday that its net profit fell 17 percent last year because of a record fine to settle money-laundering charges and charges related to the value of its debt. HSBC settled charges that it transferred billions of dollars for nations under United States sanctions, enabled Mexican drug cartels to launder tainted money through the American financial system, and worked closely with Saudi Arabian banks linked to terrorist organizations.

', u'\n                    Last year, Barclays reported a net loss of $1.5 billion, in contrast with a profit of $4.5 billion for 2011. The loss was driven by provisions to cover legal costs related to the rate-rigging scandal and other improper activities. The British bank has also announced a wide-ranging cost reduction program that includes cutting 3,700 jobs and closing some business units and branches.

', u'\n                    \u201cThe stress tests were just not very stressful,\u201d said Rebel A. Cole, a professor of finance at ', u'.        ', u'\n                    With the industry\u2019s health improving, analysts predict that most big banks will now secure the Fed\u2019s blessing to return money to shareholders, including some unexpected candidates. ', u', for example, outperformed its rivals in the test just one year after a poor performance embarrassed the bank and thwarted its plans to distribute capital to shareholders.        ', u'\n                    This year, Citigroup did not wait long to celebrate. Minutes after the results were released, the bank announced that it asked the Fed\u2019s permission to carry out $1.2 billion in stock buybacks through the first quarter of 2014.        ', u'\n                    Other banks did not fare as well. ', u', which is majority-owned by the taxpayers since the crisis, burned through nearly all its buffer under the test, which assessed how much capital would remain at the end of 2014 once banks were subjected to hefty losses.        ', u'\n                    ', u' and ', u' also produced some of the lowest capital results among large Wall Street firms. ', u' would suffer $25 billion in trading losses under the test. The results were not unexpected; all three firms have significant trading operations that can rack up big losses in turbulent times.        ', u'\n                    The test results provided an important snapshot of the financial system more than four years after the banking industry was on the brink of collapse. Regulators hailed the industrywide improvements, underscoring what they portend for consumers and the economy.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe stress tests are a tool to gauge the resiliency of the financial sector,\u201d a Federal Reserve governor, Daniel K. Tarullo, said in a statement. \u201cSignificant increases in both the quality and quantity of bank capital,\u201d he said, helps \u201censure that banks can continue to lend to consumers and businesses, even in times of economic difficulty.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Investors will pore over the results, scanning for hints about how much money banks can return to shareholders. After the crisis, regulators prevented lenders like Citigroup and ', u' from increasing their dividends or repurchasing shares, forcing them instead to hoard capital to absorb losses.        ', u'\n                    Behind the scenes, the Fed will now signal to each bank whether it can proceed with new payout plans, potentially creating a tense face-off with regulators. If the Fed objects, a bank will have an opportunity to temper its proposals for dividend payments and share buybacks before the plans are released publicly next Thursday.        ', u'\n                    The stress tests have already caused tension between regulators and banks. The results, which reveal in some detail the losses that banks will suffer under times of stress, prompted wrangling with the Fed over how to conduct the tests and how much data to release.        ', u'\n                    In another sign of friction, the banks had to run the same test as the Fed \u2014 and in some cases produced rosier results. ', u' reported a projected 9.2 percent Tier 1 common ratio, the primary measure of financial strength tracked by regulators, by the end of 2014. That was far higher than the 7 percent calculated by the Fed.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America\u2019s outlook also trumped regulators\u2019 findings, while Citigroup\u2019s forecast hewed closely to the Fed. Those sorts of discrepancies may feed suspicions that financial firms are overly optimistic about their businesses.        ', u'\n                    In its overhaul of the regulatory system after the crisis, Congress mandated stress tests to provide an annual health check for the same banks that brought the economy to its knees. The Fed\u2019s tests take banks through a series of adverse conditions, not unlike the last crisis. The tests estimated that 18 banks sustain combined losses of $462 billion, in a period of considerable financial and economic stress in which unemployment soars, stock prices halve and house prices plummet more than 20 percent.        ', u'\n                    But, to some banking analysts, the tests did not fully capture some forces and events that occur during economic and market shocks. For instance, Wall Street firms may lose access to short-term loans critical to their survival. It is almost impossible to project the impact of the rapid collapse of one or two large financial firms, as in 2008, when ', u' and ', u' imploded.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Cole of DePaul said the projected losses on loans appeared too low for the severity of the imagined cases. \u201cIf we really had an economic crisis of this magnitude, the loss rates would be at least double on the real estate loans,\u201d he said.        ', u'\n                    The numbers also show that, over the last year, the Fed has cut its loss projections for certain types of loans. Last year, it projected a 9.5 percent loss rate on Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgages, but this year that dropped to 7.1 percent. The Fed declined to comment on specific banks, but a senior official said lower loss rates were the result of an improvement in the overall quality of the banks\u2019 loan portfolios.        ', u'\n                    Still, some analysts cheered the results, saying they confirmed the increasing optimism among investors. Bank stocks have risen sharply in recent months, gains that could continue on the heels of the stress tests.        ', u'\n                    \u201cIt\u2019s a very good exercise to do, showing everyone that the U.S. banking system is well capitalized,\u201d said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets.        ', u'\n                    In a surprise, Citigroup had a projected capital equivalent to 8.9 percent of its assets at the end of 2014, well above last year\u2019s showing. Bank of America\u2019s so-called Tier 1 common capital ratio registered at 6.9 percent, also an improvement.        ', u'\n                    But Morgan Stanley\u2019s ratio came in at 6.4 percent, temporarily restrained by its purchase of the remaining stake in the Smith Barney retail brokerage joint venture. JPMorgan\u2019s capital levels stood at 6.8 percent. While those banks\u2019 stress test results are lower than rivals, they are still strong capital numbers amid a crisis.        ', u'\n                    On one important alternative measure of capital, Goldman Sachs had a poor showing compared with its peers. Under the stressed case, the bank\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratio \u2014 another measure of capital strength that treats assets more conservatively \u2014 would fall to a low of 3.9 percent.        ', u'\n                    This could become an issue in any discussions between Goldman and the Fed about the bank\u2019s capital plan. When regulators assess whether a bank can proceed with its capital plan, the Tier 1 leverage ratio cannot fall below 3 percent. Goldman\u2019s own test showed the ratio falling to only 5.1 percent.        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

At that point, Dell\u2019s board will be able to begin a campaign to convince shareholders that Mr. Dell\u2019s offer makes the most sense and that other proposals are not feasible.        ', u'\n                    One alternative being pushed by Mr. Icahn, who sent a letter to the committee on Tuesday, calls on the company to abandon the sale to Mr. Dell, according to a filing by the company on Thursday. Mr. Icahn, an activist investor, is demanding that Dell borrow $8.25 billion to help finance a special dividend of $9 a share.        ', u'\n                    (The billionaire could have checked his math in the letter before sending it, however. Adding up the breakdown of the dividend payment that he outlined \u2014 $4.26 a share from existing cash, $1.73 from borrowing against receivables and $4.26 from new loans and bonds \u2014 yields $10.25, not $9.)        ', u'\n                    It is a similar plan to what Southeastern Asset Management, another major investor opposed to the current deal, has proposed. And it shows the hurdles that Dell\u2019s special committee will face in persuading shareholders to accept the existing proposal from Mr. Dell and Silver Lake, an offer of $13.65 a share.        ', u'\n                    In his letter to the board committee, Mr. Icahn estimated that the publicly traded company was worth about $13.81 a share, making his suggested deal \u2014 a so-called leveraged recapitalization \u2014 worth about $22.81 a share.        ', u'\n                    \u201cWe believe, as apparently does Michael Dell and his partner Silver Lake, that the future of Dell is bright,\u201d Mr. Icahn wrote in the letter. \u201cWe see no reason that the future value of Dell should not accrue to all the existing Dell shareholders \u2014 not just Michael Dell.\u201d        ', u'\n                    If Dell refuses, Mr. Icahn said he would seek a challenge to the company\u2019s board, including nominating an alternate group of directors.        ', u'\n                    The special dividend payout was only the latest proposal that Mr. Icahn has suggested to the Dell special committee, according to people briefed on the matter. Within the last week, he floated the idea of buying a big chunk of the company\u2019s stock for about $15 a share.        ', u'\n                    That would have left the computer maker as a publicly traded company, but with fewer publicly traded shares.        ', u'\n                    By Tuesday, Mr. Icahn had pivoted to the demand for a special dividend. And while advisers to Dell\u2019s special committee have asked the activist to submit a formal proposal as part of the effort to find alternatives, known as the go-shop process, as of Thursday afternoon, Mr. Icahn had declined.        ', u'\n                    Advisers contend that the board is not permitted to consider Mr. Icahn\u2019s dividend-payment plan, since it is not a formal bid. That said, Mr. Icahn has continued to hold meetings with bankers at ', u', the people briefed on the matter said.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Icahn did not return a call seeking comment.        ', u'\n                    Persuading shareholders to approve the existing buyout offer in its current form is a difficult task. The deal requires the approval of a majority of independent shareholders, since Mr. Dell\u2019s stake of roughly 16 percent would not be counted.        ', u'\n                    That means at least 42.5 percent of Dell\u2019s shares must be voted in favor of the transaction. Complicating matters, abstentions count as no-votes.

', u'\n                    Investors who have publicly opposed the deal, including Southeastern and ', u', control more than 14 percent of Dell shares. Mr. Icahn described his holdings in Tuesday\u2019s letter as \u201csubstantial,\u201d but did not elaborate.        ', u'\n                    Some analysts say that the ultimate outcome may simply be a higher bid from Mr. Dell and Silver Lake.        ', u'\n                    In a note on Thursday, Peter Misek, an analyst at ', u', wrote that a bump to $15 a share was most likely.

', u'\n                    For now, it is that go-shop period that is the special committee\u2019s best defense. The directors have said that they have secured several concessions meant to help facilitate a higher offer, including Evercore being paid more if it finds a better bid and Mr. Dell\u2019s promise to work with other suitors willing to pay a higher price.        ', u'\n                    At the least, a superior alternative bid could give company directors leverage to demand more money from Mr. Dell and Silver Lake. \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to say that $13.65 a share is the greatest thing since sliced bread,\u201d said one person involved in the process.

She left in 2002 with the reputation as a tenacious prosecutor with an independent streak.

Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has questioned whether Ms. White\u2019s pledge to avoid matters involving former clients would undercut her ability to run the agency. Mr. Ceresney would probably follow Ms. White\u2019s lead and recuse himself from certain cases, an important ethical move but also a potential hindrance to his authority.        ', u'\n                    The questions surrounding the revolving door illustrate how, even as Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney prepare to usher in a new era at the S.E.C., the agency is dogged by old concerns. While the agency has mounted cases against ', u' and other Wall Street giants, consumer advocates continue to complain that the enforcement unit remains too timid.        ', u'\n                    But there is another school of thought on the revolving door \u2014 that it actually bolsters prosecutorial instincts. Anyone fit to shine a light on the darkest corners of Wall Street, S.E.C. officials say, must navigate its ins and outs. The arguments echo claims that ', u' picked the famed financier Joseph P.

In one big case, if things go wrong, Bank of America may be required to make good on many more billions worth of bad mortgages from ', u', which the bank acquired, in the sense that one acquires Ebola virus, in 2008.        ', u'\n                    Bank of America, however, has kept its legal reserves low \u2014 perhaps dangerously so.        ', u'\n                    The dispute involves a 2011 settlement that Bank of America reached with some of the world\u2019s biggest investors, including Pimco and ', u', for $8.5 billion. That amount covers more than $400 billion of Countrywide loans, on which there have been tens of billions of losses. The actual loss total is in dispute because they are estimates, but it ranges from $70 billion or so to well over $100 billion. That means, at the high end of the range, the settlement was for pennies on the dollar. On a conference call last week held by Mike Mayo, the CLSA bank analyst, a legal expert suggested that if things went south in the courts for Bank of America, the settlement might rise to $25 billion to $30 billion.

', u'\n                    Even in the fun house of litigation about mortgages, this one is particularly complicated. The dispute revolves around the question of whether another bank, BNY Mellon, working on behalf of mortgage-backed securities investors, was reasonable and acted in good faith in agreeing to the settlement. It is being hashed out in New York State Supreme Court. BNY Mellon is the trustee on 530 securitizations, or bundles of Countrywide mortgages, that were sold to investors.

The group of investors who agreed to it hold only about a quarter of the securities, making it appear as if a minority has forced a bad deal on the majority in order to get few quick bucks and resolve any dispute. The Pimcos and BlackRocks of the world don\u2019t like to sue big banks. Things can get a little uncomfortable on the golf links. (They contend it was reasonable, given all the legal uncertainties of a protracted dispute.)        ', u'\n                    And who blessed the $8.5 billion figure anyway? To figure out whether it was fair, BNY Mellon relied on a firm called RRMS Advisors, a mortgage analysis firm.        ', u'\n                    The RRMS estimate has been in dispute for some time now. The firm relied on information from Bank of America, and critics contend it underestimated problems in the loans and the total losses. How BNY Mellon found little RRMS isn\u2019t clear; the bank wouldn\u2019t comment. RRMS\u2019s Brian Lin, who conducted the analysis, stood by his report, but declined to comment further.        ', u'\n                    Recently, other court rulings have boded ill for Bank of America. Judge ', u' of the Federal District Court in Manhattan has ruled that an insurer called ', u' was able to dispute mortgages that it backed and that were made by a small bank called Flagstar, without having to show that the contractual breach was the direct cause of the loss. In other words, the borrower may have defaulted, but Assured didn\u2019t have to demonstrate that it was because she didn\u2019t make $150,000 a year as a tarot card reader, as had been claimed on the borrower\u2019s loan application. If Bank of America is hit by such a ruling too, it might have to pay more. It argues its contracts are different.        ', u'\n                    So is Bank of America vulnerable? Not surprisingly, it is keeping whole swaths of expensive Manhattan law firms working all hours of the day to make the case that it isn\u2019t. BNY Mellon, too, contends it acted reasonably.        ', u'\n                    And the banks contend the $8.5 billion settlement is in line with other similar settlements. Of course, the investors continue to face huge hurdles even if rulings in this case start to go their way.        ', u'\n                    But even if the chances are low that the cases don\u2019t go in Bank of America\u2019s favor, an increase in legal reserves could be huge. So this is a low-probability, high-risk event. Another way of saying that is that it is a \u201cstress\u201d situation. And who just put banks through stress situations?

', u'\n                    A look at Bank of America\u2019s estimates for how much it will have to pay for its mortgage liability is telling. It has gone up steadily each year. In 2009, the bank had a reserve of $3.5 billion. By last year, it had jumped to $19 billion, with an estimate of additional loss of up to another $4 billion.        ', u'\n                    And so Bank of America seems to have been consistently underestimating its legal exposure. (And it has other, undisclosed legal reserves for different cases. The incentives to lowball those are much greater, because the public cannot scrutinize them.)        ', u'\n                    In keeping the reserves low, Bank of America has already won. If it turns out that the bank loses its cases and has to pay much more money, it nevertheless has managed to make its books look that much better for years.

Mr. Dell, who controls about 16 percent of outstanding shares, will not get to cast a vote.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Icahn has already met with advisers to a special committee of Dell\u2019s board to discuss the deal, according to the person briefed on the matter. The directors had asked Mr. Icahn to participate in the process to find potential higher bids, which is scheduled to end on March 22. But Mr. Icahn refused, the person said.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Icahn could not be reached for comment. Representatives for Dell and Southeastern declined to comment on Mr. Icahn\u2019s plans.

', u'\n                    The committee also said it had requested a number of provisions meant to help any competing bidders make a higher offer.

', u', Lenovo and ', u' have all expressed interest.        ', u'\n                    The special committee, which handled the negotiations with Mr. Dell\u2019s group, added that it had considered several possible alternatives to the sale, including a transaction known as a leveraged recapitalization. In such a deal, the company would borrow billions of dollars to pay out a special dividend, but Dell would remain publicly traded.        ', u'\n                    Both Mr. Icahn and Southeastern have advocated such a move, which they said would generate more value for shareholders. Mr. Icahn has told Dell\u2019s special committee that it should consider paying about $9 a share, while Southeastern has recommended a dividend of $12 a share.        ', u'\n                    People close to the committee have warned that the company\u2019s shares may tumble if the deal dies.

But when the barbs eventually fall silent and the klieg lights dim, how will the Herbalife war end? And what truth will emerge?\n        ', u'\n                    \nThe arrival of the hedge fund billionaires \u2014 William A. Ackman, Daniel S. Loeb and ', u' \u2014 spawned a media circus. And at times, some investors acted as if they were the stars of a reality-TV show. Yet blustering and bluffing are what traders do, after all.        ', u'\n                    In the beginning, the dispute was over how Herbalife sold its products and to whom. In December, Mr. Ackman made a presentation at an investor conference, saying that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme. Herbalife vehemently denied those claims, and put on its own investor day in January to rebut them.        ', u'\n                    The focus, however, soon turned to the hedge fund celebrities. A day before Herbalife\u2019s presentation, Mr. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund, Third Point, ', u' 8.24 percent of the company\u2019s shares, giving Herbalife a huge show of support.        ', u'\n                    After Mr. Loeb, Mr. Icahn \u2014 who is worth some $15 billion, according to Forbes \u2014 entered the fray. Yet the fight first appeared to be about something other than Herbalife last month, when Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman duked it out on CNBC over real and imagined insults dating back a decade. At the time, Mr. Icahn did not disclose a position but noted that if someone tried to acquire Herbalife, it would spell trouble for Mr. Ackman because \u201cif that happens, that stock could rush to $100.\u201d        ', u'\n                    It was perhaps no surprise when Mr. Icahn ', u' that he had acquired an almost 13 percent interest in Herbalife. Mr. Icahn topped that off with an announcement last week that he had cut a deal to put two of his people on the Herbalife board and acquire as much as 25 percent of the company.        ', u'\n                    As a result, the debate over Herbalife has been reduced to the level of a junior high school feud as it becomes about traders trash-talking each other. Hedge fund billionaires may have huge egos and not like each other? Really? As Gordon Gekko says in the 1987 film \u201cWall Street,\u201d \u201cIf you need a friend, get a dog.\u201d        ', u'\n                    To employ another movie reference, what\u2019s happening with the hedge fund battle is the reverse of a famous \u201cGodfather\u201d quotation: It\u2019s not business, it\u2019s personal.        ', u'\n                    A recent exchange on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d program says it all. Under the heading \u201cThe Ackman Pain Trade,\u201d one of the hosts talked about why Mr. Ackman\u2019s claims were wrong. He stated, \u201cThe reason I think Herbalife is not a fraud is, No. 1, I have a very close personal relationship with Dan Loeb, who doesn\u2019t believe this is a fraud.\u201d Right.        ', u'\n                    So no one appears to be doing an actual investigation or asking the right questions. The central issue, in case you need reminding, is whether Herbalife is a pyramid scheme, in light of some of the questions that Mr. Ackman has raised. This is important, as not just billions are at stake, but an entire company and the tens of thousands of people who are affiliated with it.        ', u'\n                    And for all the talk of a \u201cshort war,\u201d the finance people are not likely to dictate the ending here. David Einhorn was reportedly short on Herbalife but has already closed his position. Mr. Loeb is said to have sold at least part of his stake at least, and may have sold it all. Mr. Loeb is required only to disclose the position in his quarterly reports to the ', u' in May. (Mr. Loeb declined to comment, and Mr. Einhorn did not respond to requests for comment made to his representative)        ', u'\n                    Hedge fund traders are in it for the short-term profit. And that\u2019s yet another reason the focus should be on the actual claims here instead of finance.        ', u'\n                    With the hedge fund titans exiting for a quick profit, the talk of a \u201cshort war\u201d will die down. But this still leaves Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman. It also leaves the specter of another financial trick, a short squeeze.        ', u'\n                    If a short squeeze occurs, Mr. Icahn\u2019s purchase of Herbalife shares, along with other purchases, will force Mr. Ackman to return the shares he had borrowed at a much higher price. This would be deadly \u2014 the 2008 short squeeze around Porsche\u2019s acquisition of ', u' sent VW\u2019s shares skyrocketing, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world. Mr. Ackman could lose more than a billion dollars if a similar situation were to happen at Herbalife.        ', u'\n                    But this is not likely to happen. Mr. Ackman probably didn\u2019t borrow his shares to short from hedge funds, but rather through ', u', his prime broker, using Herbalife shares held by index and other \u201csafe\u201d institutional investor funds like Fidelity. It is unlikely that these institutions will sell their shares or call them back. And shares available to short are likely to remain plentiful even after Mr. Icahn takes his full position.        ', u'\n                    Herbalife is not even among ', u', and about half of Mr. Ackman\u2019s position is traded every day on average, meaning that there is still a lot of stock out there.        ', u'\n                    So, it\u2019s unlikely that Mr. Ackman will be forced into a short squeeze without someone buying the entire company. Except for Mr. Icahn, it is hard to see anyone making a bid, given the uncertainty and the unwillingness of a bank to finance an offer. Certainly, a ', u' firm would not want to take the risk.        ', u'\n                    As for Mr. Icahn, he is taking two board seats and apparently entering into an agreement that he won\u2019t sell his shares for a year unless the price is above $73 a share. And Mr. Icahn has signed a standstill, agreeing not to make a bid unless someone else goes first.        ', u'\n                    So how will this end? It\u2019s not likely to end soon. Neither Mr. Ackman nor Mr. Icahn is going anywhere, and the rest of the hedge funds are just trading in and out, riding the waves. And while Mr. Ackman is hoping that regulators will step in and end it all, it is hard to see them acting without a very thorough and lengthy investigation.        ', u'\n                    And while Wall Street\u2019s focus, and everyone else\u2019s for that matter, has turned to the drama of two financiers who don\u2019t like each other (what\u2019s new?), it ignores what actually matters. In the absence of anyone looking at the facts, Herbalife will be under great pressure to keep its earnings up while Mr. Ackman continues to push the company to change how it reports those earnings.        ', u'\n                    Without someone buying the company, it is essentially a stalemate. The only way out appears to be over time as each quarter unfolds and Herbalife\u2019s model holds up under Mr. Ackman\u2019s scrutiny \u2014 or doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s face it, without something to stop the attacks, the company is going to undergo strain as time goes on and the questions and suspicions persist. But this could take years.

', u'\n                    Although Microsoft has appealed past punishments, it may be reluctant to do so this time, preferring to focus on its rivalry with Google. Microsoft is among the companies that have complained about Google\u2019s business practices to the commission.

', u'\n                    Mr. Almunia and Google have been negotiating since then, and a final agreement may not come until later this year, suggesting that the strategy of seeking quick results in antitrust technology cases through settlements instead of lengthy legal battles could be coming undone.

The Federal Trade Commission decided in January after a 19-month inquiry that Google had not broken antitrust laws. But Mr. Almunia has insisted that Google make changes to the most sensitive area of its business, online search.        ', u'\n                    The latest dispute stemmed from the settlement of a case concerning Microsoft\u2019s dominance in Internet browsers, a dominance that the company has ceded to market forces in recent years.        ', u'\n                    In Microsoft\u2019s settlement of 2009, the company did not pay a fine but agreed to install a system called Browser Choice Screen with Windows.

Politico earlier reported the scheduled date for the release of the report.

', u'\n                    The Senate report, however, shifts the focus from lower-level traders in London who placed the bet to senior executives and regulators who failed to stop it. Expanding on a sweeping report the bank released in January, the Congressional inquiry is expected to open a window into how executives ignored warning signs and failed to alert investors about changes to its method for detecting risk.        ', u'\n                    Because a large majority of the executives involved in the trade have since departed the bank, the hearing could increase scrutiny of Mr. Braunstein and Mr. Dimon, the remaining senior executives. Within JPMorgan, people close to the bank say, executives have expressed dismay about the lingering questions.

In an e-mail to a more senior trader in January 2012, he advised against increasing the bet, according to people who reviewed the message. The size of the trades, Mr. Iksil said, were becoming \u201cscary\u201d and advised that the investment office take the \u201cfull pain\u201d now, according to a person briefed on the e-mails. JPMorgan released the e-mails without naming the traders.        ', u'\n                    By February, Mr. Iksil grew worried as he struggled to understand why losses were escalating.

Zubrow, a former chief risk officer. Ms. Drew and Mr. Zubrow have since left the bank.

', u'\n                    The subcommittee further examined whether the bank failed to alert investors about a change in its internal alarm system. The bank in January 2012 introduced a new value-at-risk model that underestimated the losses in the investment office. The bank did not inform investors about the model change until May.

Sergeant Hurley has since reached a settlement with Deutsche Bank in his case.        ', u'\n                    But the problems are more extensive than the wave of cases indicated.

Those are big subjects in their own right. So it\u2019s not surprising that the notion of a data-driven society has not been much considered.        ', u'\n                    But someone who has was host of the meeting: Alex Pentland, a computational social scientist at the Media Lab. He put his intellectual stake in the ground last year in a presentation posted on Edge.org, ', u'        ', u'\n                    Mr. Pentland\u2019s starting point is that the most important data that is becoming available on a vast new scale is information about people\u2019s behavior. For example, he cites location data from cellphones and evermore consumption data as people increasingly use credit cards for even the smallest purchases. He distinguishes this behavioral data from less-telling data \u2014 about people\u2019s beliefs like Facebook communications or Google searches.        ', u'\n                    The fine-grained behavioral data, according to Mr. Pentland, opens the way to changing how we think about society and how a society is governed. Adam Smith and Karl Marx, he explains, thought about markets and classes, respectively. \u201cBut those are aggregates,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re averages.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Yet now, Mr. Pentland says, it becomes possible to track social phenomena down to the individual level and the social and economic connections among individuals. The ability to monitor these \u201cmicro-patterns,\u201d Mr. Pentland said, means \u201cwe\u2019re entering a new era of social physics.\u201d        ', u'\n                    What might that mean in practice? Reed Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in the Clinton administration, observed at the meeting that Big Data played a major role in the last election \u2014 a reference to the Obama campaign\u2019s deft use of data analysis to identify potential Obama voters and encourage them to cast their ballots.        ', u'\n                    \u201cYou get elected with Big Data, but you govern without it,\u201d Mr. Hundt said. \u201cHow much sense does that make?\u201d        ', u'\n                    Mr. Hundt, chief executive for the Coalition for Green Capital, a nonprofit organization, pointed to the waste in a range of government incentive and benefit programs, from tax credits for solar panels to Social Security, that results from the across-the-board approach \u2014 or policy by averages, as Mr. Pentland might put it.        ', u'\n                    Instead, a data-driven approach to solar-energy incentives would concentrate government incentives to where the payoff is greatest in terms of efficiently generating alternative energy \u2014 larger buildings with a lot of roof space instead of small houses, Mr. Hundt said. A by-the-data model for benefits programs, he added, would suggest means-testing Social Security payments as well as adjusting payments locally for differences in costs of living.        ', u'\n                    \u201cSo all men are created equal, but are subsidized individually,\u201d Mr. Hundt quipped.        ', u'\n                    Intriguing, and perhaps wise policy, but it would also seem to be a redefinition of fairness as it applies to broad benefit programs, like Social Security and Medicare, which typically make standard payments and avoid means testing.        ', u'\n                    What are the chances such a data-driven course would be politically acceptable? If the data points the way to greater efficiency, why not, Mr. Hundt replied. After all, he said, a major role of government is to transfer income to people who would benefit most \u2014 better data, closely analyzed, means government can perform that role more effectively, Mr. Hundt said.        ', u'\n                    An underlying assumption of tilting toward a data-driven society is that, as one participant put it, \u201cinformation over time wins out.\u201d That is, data will change attitudes and policy, combating bias and causing policy-making to be more of a science. To data optimists, then, the endless political squabbling and stalemate in Washington points to all the room there is for improvement.        ', u'\n                    In a Big Data world, the data-mining for patterns and insights to guide policy will be done automatically \u2014 by software algorithms.

', u'\n                    Twitter has the same type of advertising module, the sponsored tweet, but although it might highlight the ad in a user\u2019s stream, it does not suppress other people\u2019s content in the process. Everything just falls into a time-based stream.        ', u'\n                    Facebook may become dominant enough that its actions vex regulators, then it may be forced to change what it highlights.

', u'\n                    A failure by Mr. Osborne to win concessions during a monthly meeting here on Tuesday of the European Union\u2019s 27 finance ministers could fuel disenchantment with the Union among restive members of Britain\u2019s ruling Conservative party. Prime Minister David Cameron has already called for a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the Union.        ', u'\n                    Yet if Mr. Osborne pushes too hard against the bonus cap, his government risks criticism at home for succoring bankers. They are unpopular with large swaths of the British electorate for earning lavish salaries even as a prolonged economic downturn forces many households to scrimp. Many voters also resent the banking industry for receiving a series of giant bailouts paid for by taxpayers.        ', u'\n                    The meeting Tuesday will follow a Monday evening session by 17 of the same finance ministers, representatives of the euro currency union, who discussed but deferred action on a bailout request by Cyprus. That country is seeking about \u20ac17 billion, $22 billion, to shore up government finances and its banks, which were badly exposed to a debt write-down in Greece.        ', u'\n                    But for Britain, which is not a member of the euro zone, the banker bonus proposal is the main issue. The Cameron government considers the bonus cap \u201cmisguided and fear it could impact negatively on London without even combating the excessive risk-taking it was meant to address,\u201d said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a research organization based in London.        ', u'\n                    \u201cBut London is caught between a rock and a hard place, as there\u2019s much popular antipathy toward the bankers,\u201d Mr. Tilford said. The issue of banker remuneration \u201cis pretty toxic stuff Britain,\u201d he added.        ', u'\n                    Further undermining Britain\u2019s position ahead of the meeting is the result of a referendum over the weekend in Switzerland, also known for its business-friendly climate but where voters approved tighter restrictions on ', u'. That vote will give shareholders of companies listed in Switzerland a binding say on the overall pay packages for executives and directors.        ', u'\n                    The bonus cap legislation that concerns the British leadership cleared an important hurdle last week when representatives of E.U. governments and the European Parliament agreed that the coveted bonuses many bankers receive would be capped at no more than their annual salaries, starting next year. Only if a bank\u2019s shareholders approved could a bonus be higher \u2014 and even then it would be limited to no more than double the salary.        ', u'\n                    The rules are drafted so that a banker working in New York for a British bank like Barclays would be subject to the rules, as would a banker in London working for a U.S. bank like Citigroup.        ', u'\n                    Another reason Mr. Osborne may be hesitant to oppose the bonus rules too vociferously is that they are part of a legislative package that includes something his government favors: tougher rules about how much capital European banks most hold in reserve to protect against losses.        ', u'\n                    Britain and Mr. Osborne have strongly backed the higher capital requirements as essential for preventing another financial crisis.        ', u'\n                    In any event, European Union diplomats said ministers were unlikely to formally approve the rules on Tuesday because details still needed to be nailed down. That could still give Britain weeks, or even months, to press for concessions.        ', u'\n                    There are also questions among some European countries about how strictly to apply parts of the legislation requiring banks to publish detailed information on profits, taxes and subsidies on a country-by-country basis across the globe.        ', u'\n                    In the case of the separate Cyprus bailout discussions Monday evening, euro zone finance ministers were taking up talks that stalled with the country\u2019s previous, Communist-led government. That government was replaced late last month by a center-right administration, a change that has been welcomed in other European capitals.        ', u'\n                    Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who is the president of the so-called Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said Monday evening in Brussels after the group\u2019s meeting that political approval for a Cypriot bailout could happen during the second half of March.        ', u'\n                    He said an agreement had been reached with the Cypriots after face-to-face talks with the country\u2019s new finance minister, Michalis Sarris, on an independent review of how Cypriot banks are implementing anti-money laundering laws. But Mr. Dijsselbloem also declined to rule out forcing depositors in Cypriot banks to share in any losses, a move that is opposed by the new government in Nicosia.        ', u'\n                    There is a danger of a standoff between Cyprus and the so-called troika of foreign lenders \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank \u2014 over the terms of any deal. One concern for the I.M.F. may be whether Cyprus would ever be able to pay back loans that would be approximately equal to its entire gross domestic product.        ', u'\n                    \u201cI don\u2019t think that they are refusing in principle to participate,\u201d Michael Noonan, the finance minister of Ireland, said Monday about the I.M.F.\u2019s readiness to help Cyprus. \u201cI think they\u2019re indicating that the conditions are not yet in place for the board of the I.M.F. to take a decision to participate.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Another obstacle is that prominent lawmakers in Germany and other euro zone countries suspect that Cyprus has become haven for laundering Russian wealth. Meanwhile, the leadership of the newly elected Cypriot government is extremely wary of demands to remedy those and other problems.        ', u'\n                    Over the weekend Mr. Sarris, the Cypriot finance minister, warned against forcing depositors to take losses, rushing headlong into privatizations or taking an overly aggressive approach to combating money laundering \u2014 all of which, he said, could worsen the country\u2019s fragile economy.

', u'\n                    I understand the problem. Many of us lost a bunch of money in 2008-9. And if you\u2019re retired or coming up on retirement, the situation is even tougher. You\u2019re sitting on less money than you planned for and have little time to rebuild your savings.        ', u'\n                    At the same time, you may have been planning to live off the income from that money. But with interest rates near zero, the income you can safely earn has been cut dramatically.        ', u'\n                    It\u2019s a double whammy! Less money, earning less interest.        ', u'\n                    That is leading to a frantic search for alternative investments that can make up the difference quickly.        ', u'\n                    Often the search for a \u201csolution\u201d comes in two flavors:        ', u'\n                    Looking for investments that will grow fast. This is a bit like doubling down at the casino to make up for losses, often with the same outcome.        ', u'\n                    Looking for investments that pay higher interest. This is also called \u201cchasing yield.\u201d When traditional, income-generating vehicles like savings accounts or certificates of deposit are paying next to nothing, you start looking for something \u201cjust as safe,\u201d but with a higher interest rate.        ', u'\n                    Enter slick salespeople with alternative investments that just happen to solve your problem. One sentence in the Times article perfectly illustrates this point:        ', u'\n                    While the offering was unfamiliar \u2014 part ownership in a fleet of luxury cars \u2014 Ms. Beck bought the pitch because her broker had been around for years, and the product offered what seemed to be a modest annual interest rate of 7 percent.        ', u'\n                    Who wouldn\u2019t prefer a \u201cmodest 7 percent\u201d return to living with stock market gyrations or earning 1.5 percent on a bank C.D.? Sign me up!        ', u'\n                    It would be great if we could find an alternative investment like this, but what we\u2019re really talking about is finding an alternative to the basic idea of taking a risk to generate a return. The trouble is that risk and expected return are still \u2014 and will always be \u2014 closely related.        ', u'\n                    Take, for instance, stock mutual funds, which come with the risk that the value of your investment will go up or down a lot in the short term. The reward comes over the long term, with the higher returns historically associated with owning stock versus other types of investments.        ', u'\n                    Now there are other \u201csafer\u201d investments that don\u2019t come with as much risk, but offer a smaller reward, like bank C.D.\u2019s. It\u2019s common to see alternative investments pitched as comparable to these safe investments, but the numbers tell a different story.        ', u'\n                    The current average one-year C.D. nationwide pays 0.6 percent, and a five-year Treasury bill yields 0.78 percent. Those returns should give you a benchmark for the return on a relatively low-risk investment.        ', u'\n                    So when someone comes to you offering an investment that\u2019s \u201cjust like a C.D.,\u201d but it pays 7 percent, guess what: This investment is NOT just like a C.D. If it was just like a C.D., it would pay you what you expect a C.D. to yield.        ', u'\n                    Yes, we\u2019re in a terrible, tight spot. But the answer isn\u2019t to hope that a dubious, new product someone sells you will solve your problem. The odds are high it will only make things worse.

Mr. Lynch made his remarks in a conference call with analysts shortly after Barnes & Noble reported a 26 percent decline in the fiscal third quarter for the Nook segment, which includes digital tablets and e-readers.        ', u'\n                    The retrenching of the Nook unit represents a setback to the Barnes & Noble plan to build up its device business as a way of staying competitive in the rapidly changing e-book market. Last year, the company separated the division from the rest of its operations and struck deals with ', u' and Pearson for hundreds of millions of dollars in financing \u2014 signs that it viewed its digital business as the linchpin of future growth.        ', u'\n                    But the Nook, while drawing favorable reviews, failed to gain traction against more popular tablets like ', u'\u2019s Kindle Fire and ', u'\u2019s iPad, and its performance over the 2012 holiday season was tepid. Barnes & Noble warned last month that Nook sales for the quarter would fall below expectations, and executives hinted recently that the strategy of operating in the highly competitive tablet space had run its course.        ', u'\n                    \u201cThe Nook is not a failure, not technically,\u201d said James McQuivey, an analyst at ', u'. \u201cIf you go back two years and ask the Nook product managers how many Nooks they would want to sell by now, I bet they have blown past that number. The problem is the fact that the overall tablet market has actually blown way past the Nook\u2019s performance.\u201d        ', u'\n                    While saying that Barnes & Noble remained committed to the tablet and e-reader market, Mr. Lynch said the company would adjust its strategy quickly. \u201cWe are not going to continue doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said in the conference call.        ', u'\n                    The results announced Thursday underscored the challenges. The company said that Nook revenue declined to $316 million for the quarter that ended Jan. 26, from $426 million over the same period a year ago. Losses in the unit increased to $190 million, from $83 million last year, as measured before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.        ', u'\n                    Over all, the company had a net loss in the quarter of just over $6 million, compared with net income of $52 million a year ago. Revenue in all three major units \u2014 Nook, retail and college \u2014 was down.        ', u'\n                    The losses were largely because of lower-than-anticipated sales, inventory charges and higher operating expenses because of advertising costs, the company said.        ', u'\n                    Mr. Lynch said Thursday that a reformulated Nook strategy would focus more on digital content like e-books and magazines, sales of which increased by 6.8 percent in the quarter. He also said the company planned to be a leader in \u201cdigital education\u201d and that it expected that to be a growth area.        ', u'\n                    In the call with analysts, Mr. Lynch was pressed on whether Barnes & Noble\u2019s digital content was really proprietary. Mr. Lynch acknowledged that what the bookseller possessed was the ability to sell publishers\u2019 content, but he insisted that it was \u201ca strategic asset that is hard to replicate.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Wall Street seemed heartened by the company\u2019s acknowledgment that it needed to recalibrate its device business, perhaps anticipating that it would accelerate a breakup of the device and retail units. Shares of Barnes & Noble rose 3.35 percent, to close at $15.74.        ', u'\n                    The company said that there was clear evidence that digital trade book sales were \u201cflattening,\u201d meaning that the bookseller\u2019s physical retail position would be strong in the future. Mr. Lynch said Barnes & Noble continued to take market share from other physical book retailers. The company also promoted prototypes for new stores to be opened in malls and the growth of the college bookstore business.        ', u'\n                    Combined with the announcement on Monday that ', u', the company\u2019s chairman and largest shareholder, was considering purchasing the retail segment, the news added a positive gloss to the brick-and-mortar business that it had not had for some time.        ', u'\n                    That notion got some support with the earnings report. Retail sales fell just more than 10 percent in the quarter, largely because of the closing of some unprofitable stores. But Barnes & Noble had largely anticipated the lower revenue and despite the sales decline, retail profits increased 7.3 percent, to $212 million, in part because of higher sales margins and \u201cexpense management,\u201d the company said.        ', u'\n                    Despite the shift in digital strategy, Mr. Lynch emphasized that the company was not abandoning the Nook division.        ', u'\n                    \u201cNook Media has been financing itself since October of 2012 due to the strong investment partners we\u2019ve been able to attract in Microsoft and Pearson,\u201d he said. He added that the Nook segment and the physical stores drove traffic to each other and needed to remain in partnership.        ', u'\n                    But analysts sounded a skeptical note. \u201cBarnes & Noble stands at a fork in the road and rather than choose one path, it will likely need to split into two companies and let the retail business go down one path while freeing the Nook division to go down another,\u201d said Mr. McQuivey, of Forrester. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that either path will lead to the promised land, but the two units are facing such different challenges and such unique prospects that it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to try to work together to solve such different problems.\u201d        ', u'\n                    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Leonsis, its vice chairman, while they search for a replacement.        ', u'\n                    Now 32, Mr. Mason had a wild ride. Unlike many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, he never seemed to dream about building a huge company or even becoming fantastically wealthy. Groupon was an outgrowth of a start-up, the Point, which was aimed at encouraging charitable actions by groups. In late 2008, Mr. Mason and a few colleagues reformulated it as a deals shop.        ', u'\n                    Over the years, Silicon Valley start-ups had tried many forms of deal sites, but Groupon was the first to really make it work, and did so instantly. The formula was simple and compelling. People were sent e-mails of offers for, say, a local restaurant. If they bought it, they got a bargain, Groupon got a commission and the restaurant won new patrons.        ', u'\n                    In two years, Mr. Mason was turning down a reported $6 billion offer from Google. As a reminder that fate is fickle, he put in the reception area of Groupon\u2019s offices a gallery of framed magazine covers featuring Napster, Myspace and other tech wunderkinds that ultimately faded. To these losers, he then added a cover that featured Groupon.        ', u'\n                    \u201cOur marketing guy thought we should put some press on the wall, but I didn\u2019t want an atmosphere of popping the Champagne,\u201d Mr. Mason told Chicago Time Out in 2010. \u201cWe still have a mountain to climb, and other iconic companies will be a footnote in history.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Groupon\u2019s public offering, in late 2011, valued the company at $16.5 billion. It was the most talked-about tech debut between Google and Facebook. The actors, stand-up comics and other creative types who made up much of Groupon\u2019s early team watched in wonder. The company had a loose, informal style, with an editorial team as large as a midsize newspaper. Writers ', u' the gags that introduced the deals. The one for a dentist started like this: \u201cThe Tooth Fairy is a burglarizing fetishist specializing in black-market ivory trade, and she must be stopped.\u201d        ', u'\n                    But then the competition intensified, the criticism began and the stock struggled.

Mr. Rohan, the analyst, said the new chief executive \u201cwill have to refocus the company on the most productive markets with the most productive sales people.\u201d He added, \u201cGroupon needs to give up on the grand vision of becoming an operating system for local commerce and instead be the best daily deals provider it can be.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Even as the daily deals sites struggle financially \u2014 the No. 2 company, Amazon-backed LivingSocial, is in worse shape than Groupon \u2014 the number of digital coupon users in the United States continues to rise, according to eMarketer.

The question was always how you create good consistent deal flow from merchants.\u201d        ', u'\n                    She noted that in his letter, Mr. Mason talked about what was best for the customer. \u201cThey think their customer is Joe Smith who buys the Groupon,\u201d Ms. Mulpuru said. \u201cBut the customer is the merchant. They have been focusing on the wrong person.\u201d        ', u'\n                    Indeed, merchants got a lot of attention for ', u' how successful deals came close to ruining them.

If Groupon was Battletoads, it would be like I made it all the way to the Terra Tubes without dying on my first-ever play-through.\u201d He added that he was looking for a good fat camp to lose the 40 pounds he had gained at Groupon.
