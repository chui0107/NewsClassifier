"Everything now is points per possession or effective field goal percentage. Hubie even brought it up before explosion happened. When you shoot 33% on threes, it\'s like shooting 50% from the field."', u'Meanwhile, Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry is the son of former NBA three-point specialist Dell Curry. The younger Curry had no idea how important that shot would become and how important the three-pointer would be to his career.', u'"I just love to shoot them because my dad shot them," Curry said. "Growing up, me and my brother (Seth) would go in the gyms and practice shots that he shot just because it was our dad. \u2026 But I didn\'t really think kind of long\u2011term about how dominant the three\u2011point shot would be. \u2026 I just think I benefited from that was just how I viewed basketball growing up through my dad\'s eyes."', u"The three-point shot's impact on the NBA is obvious. Ten years ago, 32.5 threes were attempted in each NBA game and teams made 35.6%. This season, 44.8 three-pointers were attempted each game and teams made 35%. Percentage has remained flat as attempts have increased.", u'From 2007-08 through 2011-12, approximately 36 three-pointers were attempted per game, but that number jumped to 39.9 per game in 2012-13, 43.1 in 2013-14 and 44.8 this season.', u'While the three-pointer has grown in importance, its value is not always cut-and-dry. Last season, the champion San Antonio Spurs were 17th in three-point attempts, 12th in three-point attempt and No. 1 in three-point percentage during the regular season. None of the other three conference finalists were top-10 in threes attempted.', u'In 2012, the champion Miami Heat were 23rd in attempts, 20th in makes and 10th in percentage, but the following season, in which they repeated as champs, the Heat were sixth in attempts, third in makes and second in percentage on threes.', u'The two teams in the 2015 Finals \u2013 Cleveland and Golden State \u2013 were in the top ten in three-point attempts, three-point makes and top five in three-point percentage this season, and the other two teams in the conference finals \u2013 Atlanta and Houston \u2013 were top 10 in attempts and makes.', u"That shot \u2013 22 feet from the basket in the corners and 23 feet, nine inches on the perimeter above the break \u2013 has had an impact on Finals. In Game 4, the Cavaliers shot just 4-for-27 and Golden State 12-for-30, and in Golden State's Game 2 loss, it made just 8-for-35. In Cleveland's two Finals victories, it made 37.5% from the field. The shot makes a difference.", u'"I know this is like all the rage right now in the NBA talking about the impact of the three, not just in makes but attempts and all that," Kerr said.', u'Kerr has two of the best three-point shooters in the league \u2013 Curry and Klay Thompson. Curry attempted (646) and made (286) the most three-pointers in the league this season, and the makes broke the single-season NBA record he set last season. Thompson was 239-for-545 (43.9%) on threes this season.', u'"We don\'t just shoot them for the sake of shooting them," Kerr said. "I want open shots. To me, the whole point of the game is to get as many open shots as you can, whether it\'s a two or a three."', u'Kerr was a fine three-pointer shooter in his day but never took more than 237 in a season while Curry takes that many about every 30 games.', u'Interestingly, Kerr and Miller said the same thing in a different way.', u'"The fact is the three \u2013 the threat of the three \u2013 can get you open twos, and that\'s a big part of what we try to do," Kerr said. "We\'re not a huge post\u2011up team, but we have three\u2011point shooting, we have spacing, we play with pace.  So if we can push the ball ahead and pump fake and create a driving lane, then I\'d like as many of those as possible.', u'"So I never go into a game thinking we\'ve got to shoot X amount of threes. But I like the threat of it, and more than anything I like open shots."', u'Miller explains the same theory differently.', u'"I always tell people, when you\'re perceived as a shooter, that\'s all you need to be doing. Perception alone does it," he said. "You have to do it for a span of time where people perceive you as a shooter. If you think that guy right there can make eight threes tonight, you have to be concerned. If you don\'t think he can make eight threes, you don\'t have to be concerned."', u'That perception spreads the defense to the perimeter of the court and opens driving lanes for creators. With the right offensive players, that style taxes the defense.', u'"You can\'t keep up with the ball movement and now the paint is wide open," Miller said. "That makes it difficult. When you look at it analytically, it\'s layups and threes. With the paint being wide open, it allows for both of those."', u'Bottom line: You better have a player or two or three on your team who can make threes.']), ([u'Ross Kenseth a winner in his first race at MIS'], [u'BROOKLYN, Mich.

His teammates were unable to knock down three-pointers, and Cleveland's best offense came from Timofey Mozgov who scored career-high 28 points. But Golden State will live with that instead of three-pointers.", u'"Coach Kerr did a great job of mixing the lineup up," James said. "They have so many different interchangeable players where he can kind of decide how he wants to go with his lineups in that nature, and to start (Iguodala) gave them that boost."', u"J.R.

Kasey Kahne hadn't won a pole in nearly three years because, he said, it's not as easy as it used to be.", u'Competition has increased, margins have shrunk and Kahne has been lacking, too, he admitted. The Hendrick Motorsports driver gets his next chance to start up front on Sunday after winning the pole on Friday for the Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway.', u'Kahne won his 27th career pole, but first in the Sprint Cup series since Oct. 21, 2012 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. He covered the two-mile speedway with a best time of 35.645 seconds (201.992 mph) to claim the top spot for the third time in 23 races at Michigan.', u'"I think the competition is much closer," Kahne said. "I think the drivers, the teams are better than what they used to be. A lot of times there a tenth separates 15 cars and I don\'t remember it being quite like that when I first came into the sport when poles seemed to be easier to win at that time."', u"Kahne shouldered some of the blame, however, citing Martin Truex Jr.'s resurgence with Furniture Row Racing after the team struggled last year. Truex Jr. won his first race of the season last week at Pocono Raceway to virtually assure  Chase for the Sprint Cup berth.", u'"I just think it\'s maybe a feel in the car and, like, I\'m not finding that feel that I need to find," said Kahne, who is eighth in points but winless. "It shows with Truex, for example, what he did last year and what he\'s doing this year. They found some things that made him more comfortable in the car and he\'s flying."', u'Points leader Kevin Harvick (201.613) was second, followed by Brad Keselowski (210.449), Carl Edwards (201.067) and Ryan Blaney (201.056), who is running a part-time schedule with the Woods Brothers.', u"Not guaranteed a spot in the field if qualifying was cancelled because of rain storms that eventually didn't materialize, Blaney extended the Wood Brothers' streak to 86 consecutive starts at Michigan and 91 of 92.", u"Harvick led the first practice session and the first two rounds of qualifying but was outdone by Kahne with less than a minute left in the final session. Harvick is the only driver to have led all three rounds in the qualifying format instituted last season. He's accomplished the feat twice.", u'"I don\'t know that I got everything out of it, but all the rounds were within seven-hundredths of each other," Harvick said.', u'Four-time Michigan-winner Greg Biffle, who stands 18th in points and winless with 12 races remaining in the regular season, did his Chase for the Sprint Cup prospects no help in qualifying 21st.', u'"My guys know what we need at this track, we have had good success here over the years," he said. "We will have to wait and see where we stack up tomorrow."'])]
