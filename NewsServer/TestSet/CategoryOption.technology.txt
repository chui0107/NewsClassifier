That's bright enough to cut through the night and get any driver's attention, keeping Dad safe while he enjoys his two-wheel cruise.

Specific features include an extremely low noise (ELN) amplifier that enhances reception and it's super flexible \u2014 he can lay it flat, hang it, or stand it up with an included easel stand. The best part? You get to retire his old tinfoil coat hanger antenna for good.", u"A bottle of booze is one of the old standby gifts, but rather than pickup a six-pack of suds, why not go the extra step and let the Medea's LED-equipped vodka bottle (", u") say Happy Father's Day for you? Medea's multiple award-winning vodka is a treat on its own, but it's the insanely creative packaging \u2014 an LED strip that can be programmed to say whatever you want \u2014 that will make you the favorite child this year.", u"Lastly, if your pops is a grilling enthusiast \u2014 it seems like they almost all are, doesn't it? \u2014 you can give him a secret culinary weapon called the iGrill 2 (", u').

This child is dehydrated and it\'s this severe,\' so on and so on."', u"Medsinc is perhaps at its most ingenious when it comes to determining heart rate and respiratory rate.
